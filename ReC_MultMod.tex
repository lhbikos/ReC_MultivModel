\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{PREFACE}

\textbf{If you are viewing this document, you should know that this is a book-in-progress. Early drafts are released for the purpose teaching my classes and gaining formative feedback from a host of stakeholders. The document was last updated on 30 Apr 2021}

\href{https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c932455e-ef06-444a-bdca-acf7012d759a}{Screencasted Lecture Link}

To \emph{center} a variable in regression means to set its value at zero and interpret all other values in relation to this reference point. Regarding race and gender, researchers often center male and White at zero. Further, it is typical that research vignettes in statistics textbooks are similarly seated in a White, Western (frequently U.S.), heteronormative, framework. The purpose of this project is to create a set of open educational resources (OER) appropriate for doctoral and post-doctoral training that contribute to a socially responsive pedagogy -- that is, it contributes to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.

Statistics training in doctoral programs are frequently taught with fee-for-use programs (e.g., SPSS/AMOS, SAS, MPlus) that may not be readily available to the post-doctoral professional. In recent years, there has been an increase and improvement in R packages (e.g., \emph{psych}, \emph{lavaan}) used for in analyses common to psychological research. Correspondingly, many graduate programs are transitioning to statistics training in R (free and open source). This is a challenge for post-doctoral psychologists who were trained with other software. This OER will offer statistics training with R and be freely available (specifically in a GitHub respository and posted through GitHub Pages) under a Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike license {[}CC BY-NC-SA 4.0{]}.

Training models for doctoral programs in HSP are commonly scholar-practitioner, scientist-practitioner, or clinical-scientist. An emerging model, the \emph{scientist-practitioner-advocacy} training model incorporates social justice advocacy so that graduates are equipped to recognize and address the sociocultural context of oppression and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities \citep{mallinckrodt_scientist-practitioner-advocate_2014}. In statistics textbooks, the use of research vignettes engages the learner around a tangible scenario for identifying independent variables, dependent variables, covariates, and potential mechanisms of change. Many students recall examples in Field's \citeyearpar{field_discovering_2012} popular statistics text: Viagra to teach one-way ANOVA, beer goggles for two-way ANOVA, and bushtucker for repeated measures. What if the research vignettes were more socially responsive?

In this OER, research vignettes will be from recently published articles where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the author's identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC{[}low-middle income countries{]}),
\item
  the research is responsive to issues of justice, equity, inclusion, diversity,
\item
  the lesson's statistic is used in the article, and
\item
  there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s); or it is publicly available.
\end{itemize}

In training for multicultural competence, the saying, ``A fish doesn't know that it's wet'' is often used to convey the notion that we are often unaware of our own cultural characteristics. In recent months and years, there has been an increased awakening to the institutional and systemic racism that our systems are perpetuating. Queuing from the water metaphor, I am hopeful that a text that is recentered in the ways I have described can contribute to \emph{changing the water} in higher education and in the profession of psychology.

As a doctoral student at the University of Kansas (1992-2005), I learned that ``a foreign language'' was required for graduation. \emph{Please note that as one who studies the intersections of global, vocational, and sustainable psychology, I regret that I do not have language skills beyond English.} This could have been met with credit from high school my rural, mid-Missouri high school did not offer such classes. This requirement would have typically been met with courses taken during an undergraduate program -- but my non-teaching degree in the University of Missouri's School of Education was exempt from this. The requirement could have also been met with a computer language (fortran, C++) -- I did not have any of those either. There was a tiny footnote on my doctoral degree plan that indicated that a 2-credit course, ``SPSS for Windows'' would substitute for the language requirement. Given that it was taught by my one of my favorite professors, I readily signed up. As it turns out, Samuel B. Green, PhD, was using the course to draft chapters in the textbook \citep{green_using_2014} that has been so helpful for so many. Unfortunately, Drs. Green (1947 - 2018) and Salkind (2947 - 2017) are no longer with us. I have worn out numerous versions of their text. Another favorite text of mine was Dr.~Barbara Byrne's \citeyearpar{byrne_structural_2016}, ``Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS.'' I loved the way she worked through each problem and paired it with a published journal article, so that the user could see how the statistical evaluation fit within the larger project/article. I took my tea-stained text with me to a workshop she taught at APA and was proud of the signature she added to it (a little catfur might have fallen out). Dr.~Byrne created SEM texts for a number of statistical programs (e.g., LISREL, EQS, MPlus). As I was learning R, I wrote Dr.~Byrne, asking if she had an edition teaching SEM/CFA with R. She promptly wrote back, saying that she did not have the bandwidth to learn a new statistics package. We lost Dr.~Byrne in December 2020. I am so grateful to these role models for their contributions to my statistical training. I am also grateful for the doctoral students who have taken my courses and are continuing to provide input for how to improve the materials.

The inspiration for training materials that re*center statistics and research methods came from the \href{https://www.academics4blacklives.com/}{Academics for Black Survival and Wellness Initiative}. This project, co-founded by Della V. Mosley, Ph.D., and Pearis L. Bellamy, M.S., made clear the necessity and urgency for change in higher education and the profession of psychology.

At very practical levels, I am indebted to SPU's Library, and more specifically, SPU's Education, Technology, and Media Department. Assistant Dean for Instructional Design and Emerging Technologies, R. John Robertson, MSc, MCS, has offered unlimited consultation, support, and connection. Senior Instructional Designer in Graphics \& Illustrations, Dominic Wilkinson, designed the logo and bookcover. Psychology and Scholarly Communications Librarian, Kristin Hoffman, MLIS, has provided consultation on topics ranging from OERS to citations. I am alo indebted to Associate Vice President, Teaching and Learning at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Rajiv Jhangiani, PhD. Dr.~Jhangiani's text \citeyearpar{jhangiani_research_2019} was the first OER I ever used and I was grateful for his encouraging conversation.

Financial support for this text has been provided from the \emph{Call to Action on Equity, Inclusion, Diversity, Justice, and Social Responsivity
Request for Proposals} grant from the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (2021-2022).

\hypertarget{what-to-expect-in-each-chapter}{%
\section{What to expect in each chapter}\label{what-to-expect-in-each-chapter}}

This textbook is intended as \emph{applied,} in that a primary goal is to help the scientist-practitioner-advocate use a variety of statistics in research problems and \emph{writing them up} for a program evaluation, dissertation, or journal article. In support of that goal, I try to provide just enough conceptual information so that the researcher can select the appropriate statistic (i.e., distinguishing between when ANOVA is appropriate and when regression is appropriate) and assign variables to their proper role (e.g., covariate, moderator, mediator).

This conceptual approach does include occasional, step-by-step, \emph{hand-calculations} (only we calculate them arithmetically in R) to provide a \emph{visceral feeling} of what is happening within the statistical algorithm that may be invisible to the researcher. Additionally, the conceptual review includes a review of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data and research design that are required for the statistic. Statistics can be daunting, so I have worked hard to establish a \emph{workflow} through each analysis. When possible, I include a flowchart that is referenced frequently in each chapter and assists the the researcher keep track of their place in the many steps and choices that accompany even the simplest of analyses.

As with many statistics texts, each chapter includes a \emph{research vignette.} Somewhat unique to this resource is that the vignettes are selected from recently published articles. Each vignette is chosen with the intent to meet as many of the following criteria as possible:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the statistic that is the focus of the chapter was properly used in the article,
\item
  the author's identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC {[}low middle income countries{]}),
\item
  the research has a justice, equity, inclusion, diversity, and social responsivity focus and will contribute positively to a social justice pedagogy, and
\item
  the data is available in a repository or there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s).
\end{itemize}

In each chapter we employ \emph{R} packages that will efficiently calculate the statistic and the dashboard of metrics (e.g., effect sizes, confidence intervals) that are typically reported in psychological science.

\hypertarget{strategies-for-accessing-and-using-this-oer}{%
\section{Strategies for Accessing and Using this OER}\label{strategies-for-accessing-and-using-this-oer}}

There are a number of ways you can access this resource. You may wish to try several strategies and then select which works best for you. I demonstrate these in the screencast that accompanies this chapter.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Simply follow along in the .html formatted document that is available on via GitHub Pages, and then

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open a fresh .rmd file of your own, copying (or retyping) the script and running it
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Locate the original documents at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling}{GitHub repository} . You can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open them to simply take note of the ``behind the scenes'' script
  \item
    copy/download individual documents that are of interest to you
  \item
    fork a copy of the entire project to your own GitHub site and further download it (in its entirety) to your personal workspace. The \href{https://desktop.github.com/}{GitHub Desktop app} makes this easy!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Listen to the accompanying lectures (I think sound best when the speed is 1.75). The lectures are being recorded in Panopto and should include the closed captioning.
\item
  Provide feedback to me! If you fork a copy to your own GitHub repository, you can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open up an editing tool and mark up the document with your edits,
  \item
    start a discussion by leaving comments/questions, and then
  \item
    sending them back to me by committing and saving. I get an e-mail notiying me of this action. I can then review (accepting or rejecting) them and, if a discussion is appropriate, reply back to you.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{if-you-are-new-to-r}{%
\section{If You are New to R}\label{if-you-are-new-to-r}}

R can be oveRwhelming. Jumping right into advanced statistics might not be the easiest way to start. However, in these chapters, I provide complete code for every step of the process, starting with uploading the data. To help explain what R script is doing, I sometimes write it in the chapter text; sometimes leave hastagged-comments in the chunks; and, particularly in the accompanying screencasted lectures, try to take time to narrate what the R script is doing.

I've found that, somewhere on the internet, there's almost always a solution to what I'm trying to do. I am frequently stuck and stumped and have spent hours searching the internet for even the tiniest of things. When you watch my videos, you may notice that in my R studio, there is a ``scRiptuRe'' file. I takes notes on the solutions and scripts here -- using keywords that are meaningful to me so that when I need to repeat the task, I can hopefully search my own prior solutions and find a fix or a hint.

\hypertarget{base-r}{%
\subsection{Base R}\label{base-r}}

The base program is free and is available here: \url{https://www.r-project.org/}

Because R is already on my machine (and because the instructions are sufficient), I will not walk through the instllation, but I will point out a few things.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Follow the instructions for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux)
\item
  The ``cran'' (I think ``cranium'') is the \emph{Comprehensive R Archive Network.} In order for R to run on your computer, you have to choose a location. Because proximity is somewhat related to processing speed, select one that is geographically ``close to you.''
\item
  You will see the results of this download on your desktop (or elsewhere if you chose to not have it appear there) but you won't ever use R through this platform.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-studio}{%
\subsection{R Studio}\label{r-studio}}

\emph{R Studio} is the desktop application I work in R. It's a separate download. Choose the free, desktop, option that is appropriate for your operating system: \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Upper right window: Includes several tabs; we frequently monitor the

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Environment: it lists the \emph{objects} that are available to you (e.g., dataframes)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Lower right window: has a number of helpful tabs.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Files: Displays the file structure in your computer's environment. Make it a practice to (a) organize your work in small folders and (b) navigating to that small folder that is holding your project when you are working on it.
  \item
    Packages: Lists the packages that have been installed. If you navigate to it, you can see if it is ``on.'' You can also access information about the package (e.g., available functions, examples of script used with the package) in this menu. This information opens in the Help window.
  \item
    Viewer and Plots are helpful, later, when we can simultaneously look at our output and still work on our script.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Primary window

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    R Studio runs in the background(in the console). Very occasionally, I can find useful troubleshooting information here.
  \item
    More commonly, I open my R Markdown document so that it takes the whole screen and I work directly, right here.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{R Markdown} is the way that many analysts write \emph{script}, conduct analyses, and even write up results. These are saved as .rmd files.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In R Studio, open an R Markdown document through File/New File/R Markdown
  \item
    Specify the details of your document (title, author, desired ouput)
  \item
    In a separate step, SAVE this document (File/Save{]} into a NEW FILE FOLDER that will contain anything else you need for your project (e.g., the data).
  \item
    \emph{Packages} are at the heart of working in R. Installing and activating packages require writing script.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-hygiene}{%
\subsection{R Hygiene}\label{r-hygiene}}

Many initial problems in R can be solved with good R hygiene. Here are some suggestions for basic practices. It can be tempting to ``skip this.'' However, in the first few weeks of class, these are the solutions I am presenting to my students.

\hypertarget{everything-is-documented-in-the-.rmd-file}{%
\subsubsection{Everything is documented in the .rmd file}\label{everything-is-documented-in-the-.rmd-file}}

Although others do it differently, everything is in my .rmd file. That is, for uploading data and opening packages I write the code in my .rmd file. Why? Because when I read about what I did hours or years later, I have a permanent record of very critical things like (a) where my data is located, (b) what version I was using, and (c) what package was associated with the functions.

\hypertarget{file-organization}{%
\subsubsection{File organization}\label{file-organization}}

File organization is a critical key to this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a project file folder.
\item
  Put the data file in it.
\item
  Open an R Markdown file.
\item
  Save it in the same file folder.
\item
  When your data and .rmd files are in the same folder (not your desktop, but a shared folder), they can be connected.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{chunks}{%
\subsubsection{Chunks}\label{chunks}}

The R Markdown document is an incredible tool for integrating text, tables, and analyses. This entire OER is written in R Markdown. A central feature of this is ``chunks.''

The easiest way to insert a chunk is to use the INSERT/R command at the top of this editor box. You can also insert a chunk with the keyboard shortcut: CTRL/ALT/i

``Chunks'' start and end with with those three tic marks and will show up in a shaded box, like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#hashtags let me write comments to remind myself what I did}
\CommentTok{\#here I am simply demonstrating arithmetic (but I would normally be running code)}
\DecValTok{2021} \SpecialCharTok{{-}} \DecValTok{1966}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 55
\end{verbatim}

Each chunk must open and close. If one or more of your tic marks get deleted, your chunk won't be read as such and your script will not run. The only thing in the chunks should be script for running R; you can hashtag-out script so it won't run.

Although unnecessary, you can add a brief title for the chunk in the opening row, after the ``r.'' These create something of a table of contents of all the chunks -- making it easier to find what you did. You can access them in the ``Chunks'' tab at the bottom left of R Studio. If you wish to knit a document, you cannot have identical chunk titles.

You can put almost anything you want in the space outside of tics. Syntax for simple formatting in the text areas (e.g,. using italics, making headings, bold, etc.) is found here: \url{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html}

\hypertarget{packages}{%
\subsubsection{Packages}\label{packages}}

As scientist-practitioners (and not coders), we will rely on \emph{packages} to do our work for us. At first you may feel overwhelmed about the large number of packages that are available. Soon, though, you will become accustomed to the ones most applicable to our work (e.g., psych, tidyverse, lavaan, apaTables).

Researchers treat packages differently. In these lectures, I list all the packages we will use in an opening chunk that asks R to check to see if the package is installed, and if not, installs it.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialCharTok{!}\FunctionTok{require}\NormalTok{(psych))\{}\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"psych"}\NormalTok{)\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Loading required package: psych
\end{verbatim}

To make a package operable, you need to open it through the library. This process must be repeated each time you restart R. I don't open the package (through the ``library(package\_name)'') command until it is time to use it. Especially for new users, I think it's important to connect the functions with the specific packages.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#install.packages ("psych")}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{ (psych)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you type in your own ``install.packages'' code, hashtag it out once it's been installed. It is problematic to continue to re-run this code .

\hypertarget{knitting}{%

\subsection{tRoubleshooting in R maRkdown}\label{troubleshooting-in-r-markdown}}

Hiccups are normal. Here are some ideas that I have found useful in getting unstuck.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In an R script, you must have everything in order -- Every. Single. Time.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    All the packages have to be in your library and activated; if you restart R, you need to reload each package.
  \item
    If you open an .rmd file and want a boxplot, you cannot just scroll down to that script. You need to run any \emph{prerequisite} script (like loading the package, importing data, putting the data in the global environment, etc.)
  \item
    Do you feel lost? clear your global environment (broom) and start at the top of the R script. Frequent, fresh starts are good.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Your .rmd file and your data need to be stored in the same file folder. These should be separate for separate projects, no matter how small.
\item
  Type any warnings you get into a search engine. Odds are, you'll get some decent hints in a manner of seconds. Especially at first, these are common errors:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The package isn't loaded (if you restarted R, you need to reload your packages)
  \item
    The .rmd file has been saved yet, or isn't saved in the same folder as the data
  \item
    Errors of punctuation or spelling
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Restart R (it's quick -- not like restarting your computer)
\item
  If you receive an error indicating that a function isn't working or recognized, and you have loaded the package, type the name of the package in front of the function with two colons (e.g., psych::describe(df). If multiple packages are loaded with functions that have the same name, R can get confused.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{strategies-for-success}{%
\subsection{stRategies for success}\label{strategies-for-success}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Engage with R, but don't let it overwhelm you.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The \emph{mechanical is also the conceptual}. Especially when it is \emph{simpler}, do try to retype the script into your own .rmd file and run it. Track down the errors you are making and fix them.
  \item
    If this stresses you out, move to simply copying the code into the .rmd file and running it. If you continue to have errors, you may have violated one of the best practices above (Is the package loaded? Are the data and .rmd files in the same place? Is all the prerequisite script run?).
  \item
    Still overwhelmed? Keep moving forward by downloading a copy of the .rmd file that accompanies any given chapter and just ``run it along'' with the lecture. Spend your mental power trying to understand what each piece does. Then select a practice problem that is appropriate for your next level of growth.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Copy script that works elsewhere and replace it with your datafile, variables, etc.\\
\item
  The leaRning curve is steep, but not impossible. Gladwell\citeyearpar{gladwell_outliers_2008} reminds us that it takes about 10,000 hours to get GREAT at something (2,000 to get reasonably competent). Practice. Practice. Practice.
\item
  Updates to R, R Studio, and the packages are NECESSARY, but can also be problematic. It could very well be that updates cause programs/script to fail (e.g., ``X has been deprecated for version X.XX''). Moreover, this very well could have happened between my distribution of these resources and your attempt to use it. My personal practice is to update R, R Studio, and the packages a week or two before each academic term.
\item
  Embrace your downward dog. Also, walk away, then come back.
\end{itemize}

The focus of this chapter is the process of starting with raw data and preparing it for multivariate analysis. To that end, we will address the conceptual considerations and practical steps in ``scrubbing and scoring.''

A twist in this lesson is that I am asking you to contribute to the dataset that serves as the basis for the chapter and the practice problems. In the spirit of \emph{open science}, this dataset is available to you and others for your own learning. Before continuing, please take 15-20 minutes to complete the survey titled, \href{https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU}{Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise}. The study is approved by the Institutional Review Board at Seattle Pacific University (SPUIRB\# 202102011, no expiration). Details about the study, including an informed consent, are included at the link.

There is about 90 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be good to add another hour.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Import data from Qualtrics into R.
\item
  Begin the scrubbing process by applying exclusion and inclusion criteria.
\item
  Rename variables.
\item
  Create a smaller dataframe with variables appropriate for testing a specific statistical model.
\item
  Use critical data manipulation functions from the \emph{tidyverse} (and \emph{dplyr}) in particular such as \emph{filter()}, \emph{select()}, and \emph{mutate()} to prepare variables.
\item
  Articulate the initial steps in a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice}}

The suggestions for practice will start with this chapter and continue in the next two chapters (Scoring, Data Dx). Using Parent's \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} AIA approach to managing missing data, you will scrub-and-score a raw dataset. Options of graded complexity could incude:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written.
\item
  Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose. Hey :)
\item
  Begin with raw data to which you have access.

Here is a narration of the figure:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The workflow begins by importing data into R. Most lessons in this series involve simulated data that are created directly in R. Alternatively, data could be:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    imported ``intRavenously'' through programs such as Qualtrics,
  \item
    exported from programs such as Qualtrics to another program (e.g., .xlxs, .csv),
  \item
    imported in other forms (e.g., .csv,.sps, .sav).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Scrubbing data by

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    variable naming,
  \item
    specifying variable characteristics such as factoring,
  \item
    ensuring that included particpiants consented to participation,
  \item
    determining and executing the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Conduct preliminary data diagnostics such as

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    outlier anlaysis
  \item
    assessing for univariate and multivariate analysis
  \item
    making transformations and/or corrections
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Managing missingness by one of two routes

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Available information analysis \citep{parent_handling_2013} at either the item-level or scale level. The result is a single set of data for analysis. If missingness remains, options include pairwise deletion, listwise deletion, or specifying FIML (when available). Another option is to use multiple imputation.
  \item
    Multiple imputation at either scale level or item-level

\hypertarget{research-vignette}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette}}

To provide first-hand experience as both the respondent and analyst for the same set of data, you were asked to complete a survey titled, \href{https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU}{Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise}. If you haven't yet completed it, please consider doing so, now. In order to reduce the potential threats to validity by providing background information about the survey, I will wait to describe it until later in the chapter.

The survey is administered in Qualtrics. In the chapter I teach two ways to import Qualtrics data into R. We will then use the data to work through the steps identified in the workflow.

\hypertarget{working-the-problem}{%
\section{Working the Problem}\label{working-the-problem}}

\hypertarget{intravenous-qualtrics}{%
\subsection{intRavenous Qualtrics}\label{intravenous-qualtrics}}

I will demonstrate using a Qualtrics account at my institution, Seattle Pacific University. The only surveys in this account are for the \emph{Recentering Psych Stats} chapters and lessons. All surveys are designed to not capture personally identifying information.

Access credentials for the institutional account, individual user's account, and survey are essential for getting the survey items and/or results to export into R. The Qualtrics website provides a tutorial for \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/integrations/api-integration/overview/\#GeneratingAnAPIToken}{generating an API token}.

We need two pieces of information: the \textbf{root\_url} and an \textbf{API token}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Log into your respective qualtrics.com account.
\item
  Select Account Settings
\item
  Choose ``Qualtrics IDs'' from the user name dropdown
\end{itemize}

We need the \textbf{root\_url}. This is the first part of the web address for the Qualtrics account. For our institution it is: spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com

The API token is in the box labeled, ``API.'' If it is empty, select, ``Generate Token.'' If you do not have this option, locate the \emph{brand administrator} for your Qualtrics account. They will need to set up your account so that you have API privileges.

\emph{BE CAREFUL WITH THE API TOKEN} This is the key to your Qualtrics accounts. If you leave it in an .rmd file that you forward to someone else, this key and the base URL gives access to every survey in your account. If you share it, you could be releasing survey data to others that would violate confidentiality promises in an IRB application.

If you mistakenly give out your API token you can generate a new one within your Qualtrics account and re-protect all its contents.

You do need to change the API key/token if you want to download data from a different Qualtrics account. If your list of surveys generates the wrong set of surveys, restart R, make sure you have the correct API token and try again.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\emph{all\_surveys()} generates a dataframe containing information about all the surveys stored on your Qualtrics account.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{About the \emph{Rate-a-Recent-Course} Survey}{About the Rate-a-Recent-Course Survey}}\label{about-the-rate-a-recent-course-survey}}

As a teaching activity for the ReCentering Psych Stats OER, the topic of the survey was selected to be consistent with the overall theme of OER. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to understand the campus climate for students whose identities make them vulnerable to bias and discrimination. These include students who are Black, non-Black students of color, LGBTQ+ students, international students, and students with disabilities.

Although the dataset should provide the opportunity to test a number of statistical models, one working hypothesis that framed the study is that the there will be a greater sense of belonging and less bias and discrimination when there is similar representation (of identities that are often marginalized) in the instructional faculty and student body. Termed, ``structural diversity'' \citep{lewis_black_2019} this is likely an oversimplification. In fact, an increase in diverse representation without attention to interacting factors can increase hostility on campus \citep{hurtado_linking_2007}. Thus, we included the task of rating of a single course relates to the larger campus along the dimensions of belonging and bias/discrimination. For example, if a single class has higher ratings on issues of inclusivity, diversity, and respect, we would expect that sentiment to be echoed in the broader institution.

Our design has notable limitations You will likely notice that we ask about demographic characteristics of the instructional staff and classmates in the course rated, but we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent. In making this decision, we likely lose important information; Iacovino and James \citeyearpar{iacovino_retaining_2016} have noted that White students perceive campus more favorably than Black student counterparts. We made this decision to protect the identity of the respondent. As you will see when we download the data, if a faculty member asked an entire class to take the survey, the datestamp and a handful of demographic identifiers could very likely identify a student. In certain circumstances, this might be risky in that private information (i.e., gender nonconformity, disclosure of a disability) or course evaluation data could be related back to the student.

Further, the items that ask respondents to \emph{guess} the identities of the instructional staff and classmates are limited, and contrary to best practices in survey construction that recommend providing the option of a ``write-in'' a response. After consulting with a diverse group of stakeholders and subject matter experts (and revising the response options numerous times) I have attempted to center anti-Black racism in the U.S. \citep{mosley_critical_2021, mosley_radical_2020, singh_building_2020}. In fact, the display logic does not present the race items when the course is offered outside the U.S. There are only five options for race: \emph{biracial/multiracial}, \emph{Black}, \emph{non-Black person(s) of color}, \emph{White}, and \emph{I did not notice} (intended to capture a color-blind response). One unintended negative consequence of this design is that the response options could contribute to \emph{colorism} \citep{adames_fallacy_2021, capielo_rosario_acculturation_2019}. Another possibility is that the limited options may erase, or make invisible, other identities. At the time that I am writing the first draft of this chapter, the murder of six Asian American women in Atlanta has just occurred. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremeism has documented that while overall hate drimes dropped by 7\% in 2020, anti-Asian hate crimes reported to the police in America's largest cities increasedby 149\% \citep{noauthor_fact_nodate}. These incidents have occurred not only in cities, but in our neighborhoods and on our campusus \citep{kim_guest_2021, kim_yes_2021, noauthor_stop_nodate}. While this survey is intended to assess campus climate as a function of race, it unfortunately does not distinguish between many identities that experience marginalization.

In parallel, the items asking respondents to identity characteristics of the instructional staff along dimensions of gender, international status, and disability are ``large buckets'' and do not include ``write-in'' options. Similarly, there was no intent to cause harm by erasing or making invisible individuals whose identities are better defined by different descriptors. Further, no write-in items were allowed. This was also intentional to prevent potential harm caused by people who could leave inappropriate or harmful comments.

\hypertarget{the-codebook}{%
\subsection{The Codebook}\label{the-codebook}}

In order to scrub-and-score a survey, it is critical to know about its content, scoring directions for scales/subscales, and its design. A more complete description of the survey design elements is (or will be) available in the \emph{Recentering Psych Stats: Psychometric} OER. The review in this chapter provides just-enough information to allow us to make decisions about which items to retain and how to score them. When they are well-written, information in the \href{./Bikos_ReCenteringPsychStats_ReCupload.pdf}{IRB application} and \href{https://osf.io/a8e5u}{pre-registration} can be helpful in the scrubbing and scoring process.

Let's look ``live'' at the survey. In Qualtrics it is possible to \emph{print} a PDF that looks very similar to its presentation when someone is taking it. You can access that static version \href{./Rate_a_CoursePDF.pdf}{here}.

We can export a \href{./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf}{codebook}, that is, a Word (or PDF) version of the survey with all the coding. In Qualtrics the protocol is: Survey/Tools/ImportExport/Export Survey to Word. Then select all the options you want (especially ``Show Coded Values''). A tutorial provided by Qualtrics can be found \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/}{here}. This same process can be used to print the PDF example I used above.

It is almost impossible to give this lecture without some reference to Qualtrics and the features used in Qualtrics. An import of raw data from Qualtrics into R can be nightmare in that the Qualtrics-assigned variable names are numbers (e.g., QID1, QID2) -- but often out of order because the number is assigned when the question is first created. If the survey is reordered, the numbers get out of sequence.

Similarly, values for Likert-type scales can also get out of order if the scale anchors are revised (which is common to do).

I recommend providing custom variable names and recode values directly in Qualtrics before exporting them into R. A Qualtrics tutorial for this is provided \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/question-options/recode-values/}{here}. In general, consider these qualities when creating variable names:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Brevity: historically, SPSS variable names could be a maximum of 8 characters.
\item
  Intuitive: although variables can be renamed in R (e.g., for use in charts and tables), it is helpful when the name imported from Qualtrics provides some indication of what the variable is.
\item
  Systematic: start items in a scale with the same stem, followed by the item number -- ITEM1, ITEM2, ITEM3.
\end{itemize}

The Rate-a-Recent-Course survey was written using some special features in Qualtrics. These include

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Display logic

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Items that are U.S.-centric are only shown if the respondent is taking a course from an institution in the U.S. is a student in the U.S.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Loop and merge

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Because course may have multiple instructional staff, the information asking about demographic characteristics of the instructors is repeated according to the number input by the respondent
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Random presentation of the 30 items asking about campus climate for the five groups of students

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Although this might increase the cognitive load of the survey, this helps ``spread out'' missingness for respondents who might tire of the survey and stop early
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Rank ordering of the institutional level (department, school/faculty, campus/university) to which the respondent feels most connected
\end{itemize}

Looking at the QTRX\_df, \emph{StartDate} thru \emph{UserLanguage} are metadata created by Qualtrics. The remaining variables and associated value labels are in the \href{./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf}{codebook}.

\hypertarget{scrubbing}{%
\section{Scrubbing}\label{scrubbing}}

With a look at our survey, codebook, and imported data, we now get to the business of scRubbing (deleting those who did not give consent, deleting previews, etc.). This level of ``scrubbing'' precedes the more formal detection of outliers.

\hypertarget{tools-for-data-manipulations}{%
\subsection{Tools for Data Manipulations}\label{tools-for-data-manipulations}}

The next stages will provide some experience manipulating data with \textbf{dplyr} from the \textbf{tidyverse}.

The \textbf{tidyverse} is a system of packages (i.e,. when you download the tidyverse, you download all its packages/members) for data manipulation, exploration and visualization. The packages in the tidyverse share a common design philosophy. These were mostly developed by Hadley Wickham, but more recently, more designers are contributing to them. Tidyverse packages are intended to make statisticians and data scientists more productive by guiding them through workflows that facilitate communication and result in reproducible work products. Fundamentally, the tidyverse is about the connections between the tools that make the workflow possible. Critical packages in the tidyverse include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{dplyr}: data manipulation: mutate, select, filter, summarize, arrange
\item
  \textbf{ggplot2}: extravagant graphing
\item
  \textbf{tibble}: a \emph{tibble} is a dataframe that provides the user with more (and less) control over the data.
\item
  \textbf{readr}: gives access to ``rectangular data'' like .csv and tables
\item
  \textbf{tidyr}: tidy data is where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, each value is a cell (duh). \textbf{tidyr}'s contributions are gather(wide to long) and spread(long to wide) as well as separate, extract, unite.
\item
  \textbf{purrr}: facilitates working with functions and vectors. For example, if you write a function, using purrr may help you replace loops with code that is more efficient and intuitive.
\end{itemize}

The tidyverse is ever-evolving -- so check frequently for updates and troubleshooting.

A handy cheatsheet for data transformation is found \href{https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf}{here}.

\hypertarget{inclusion-and-exclusion-criteria}{%
\subsection{Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria}\label{inclusion-and-exclusion-criteria}}

For me, the first pass at scrubbing is to eliminate the obvious. In our case this is includes \emph{previews} and respondents who did not consent to continue. Previews are the researcher-initiated responses usually designed to proofread or troubleshoot survey problems. There could be other first-pass-deletions, such as selecting response between certain dates.

I think these first-pass deletions, especially the ones around consent, are important to do as soon as possible. Otherwise, we might delete some of the variables (e.g., timestamps, consent documentation, preview status) and neglect to delete these cases later in the process.

We are here in the workflow:

We can either update the existing df (by using the same object), or creating a new df from the old. Either works. In my early years, I tended to create lots of new objects. As I have gained confidence in myself and in R, I'm inclined to update the existing df. Why? Because unless you write the object as an outfile (using the same name for the object as for the filename -- which I do not recommend), the object used in R does not change the source of the dat. Therefore, it is easy to correct early code and it keeps the global environment less cluttered.

In this particular survey, the majority of respondents will take the survey because they clicked an \emph{anonymous} link provided by Qualtrics. Another Qualtrics distribution method is e-mail. At the time of this writing, we have not recruited by e-mail, but it is is possible we could do so in the future. What we should not include, though, are \emph{previews}. These are the times when the researcher is self-piloting the survey to look for errors and to troubleshoot.

APA Style, and in particular the Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) for quantitative research specify that we should report the frequency or percentages of missing data. We would start our counting \emph{after} eliminating the previews.

Next let's filter in only those who consented to take the survey. Because Qualtrics discontinued the survey for everyone who did not consent, we do not have to worry that their data is unintentionally included, but it can be useful to mention the number of non-consenters in the summary of missing data.

In this particular study, the categories used to collect race were U.S.-centric. Thus, they were only shown if the respondent indicated that the course being rated was taught by an institution in the U.S. Therefore, an an additional inclusion criteria for this specific research model should be that the course was taught in the U.S.

\hypertarget{renaming-variables}{%
\subsection{Renaming Variables}\label{renaming-variables}}

Even though we renamed the variables in Qualtrics, the loop-and-merge variables were auto-renamed such that they each started with a number. I cannot see how to rename these from inside Qualtrics. A potential problem is that, in R, when variable names start with numbers, they need to be surrounded with single quotation marks. I find it easier to rename them now. I used ``i'' to start the variable name to represent ``instructor.''

The form of the \emph{rename()} function is this:
df\_named \textless- rename(df\_raw, NewName1 = OldName1)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\NormalTok{QTRX\_df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{rename}\NormalTok{(QTRX\_df, }\AttributeTok{iRace1 =} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}1\_iRace\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{iRace2 =} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}2\_iRace\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{iRace3 =} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}3\_iRace\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{iRace4 =} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}4\_iRace\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{iRace5 =} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}5\_iRace\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{iRace6 =} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}6\_iRace\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{iRace7 =} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}7\_iRace\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{iRace8 =} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}8\_iRace\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{iRace9 =} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}9\_iRace\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{iRace10 =} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}10\_iRace\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Also in Qualtrics, it was not possible to rename the variable (formatted with sliders) that asked respondents to estimate the proportion of classmates in each race-based category. Using the codebook, we can do this now. I will use ``cm'' to precede each variable name to represent ``classmates.''

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{QTRX\_df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{rename}\NormalTok{(QTRX\_df, }\AttributeTok{cmBiMulti =}\NormalTok{ Race\_10, }\AttributeTok{cmBlack =}\NormalTok{ Race\_1, }\AttributeTok{cmNBPoC =}\NormalTok{ Race\_7, }\AttributeTok{cmWhite =}\NormalTok{ Race\_8, }\AttributeTok{cmUnsure =}\NormalTok{ Race\_2)}

Let's also create an ID variable (different from the lengthy Qualtrics-issued ID) and then move it to the front of the distribution.

\hypertarget{downsizing-the-dataframe}{%
\subsection{Downsizing the Dataframe}\label{downsizing-the-dataframe}}

Although researchers may differ in their approach, my tendency is to downsize the df to the variables I will be using in my study. These could include variables in the model, demographic variables, and potentially auxiliary variables (i.e,. variables not in the model, but that might be used in the case of multiple imputation).

This particular survey did not collect demographic information, so that will not be used. The model that I will demonstrate in this research vignette examines the the respondent's perceived campus climate for students who are Black, predicted by the the respondent's own campus belonging, and also the \emph{structural diversity} \citep{lewis_black_2019} proportions of Black students in the classroom and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) instructional staff.

\emph{I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the \%Black instructional staff. At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the staff to model this.}

The \emph{select()} function can let us list the variables we want to retain.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#You can use the ":" to include all variables from the first to last variable in any sequence; I could have written this more efficiently.  I just like to "see" my scales and clusters of variables.}

Starting with this chapter, the practice problems for this and the next two chapters (i.e., Scoring, Data Dx) are connected. Whatever practice option(s) you choose, please (a) use raw data that (b) has some data missing. This second criteria will be important in the subsequent chapters.

The three problems below are listed in the order of graded complexity. If you are just getting started, you may wish to start with the first problem. If you are more confident, choose the second or third option. You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis.

\hypertarget{problem-1-rework-the-chapter-problem}{%
\subsection{Problem \#1: Rework the Chapter Problem}\label{problem-1-rework-the-chapter-problem}}

Because the \emph{Rate-a-Recent-Course} survey remains open, it is quite likely that there will be more participants who have taken the survey since this chapter was last updated. If not -- please encourage a peer to take it. Even one additional response will change the results. This practice problem encourages you to rework the chapter, as written, with the updated data from the survey.

Before starting this option, choose a minimum of three variables from the \emph{Rate-a-Recent-Course} survey to include in a simple statistical model. Work through the chapter making decisions that are consistent with the research model you have proposed. There will likely be differences at several points in the process. For example, you may wish to include (not exclude) data where the rated-course was offered by an institution outside the U.S. Different decisions may involve an internet search for the R script you will need as you decide on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

\subsection{Importing data from an exported Qualtrics .csv file}\label{importing-data-from-an-exported-qualtrics-.csv-file}}

The lecture focused on the ``intRavenous'' import. It is is also possible to download the Qualtrics data in a variety of formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, SPSS). Since I got started using files with the CSV extension (think ``Excel'' lite), that is my preference.

In Qualtrics, these are the steps to download the data: Projects/YOURsurvey/Data \& Analysis/Export \& Import/Export data/CSV/Use numeric values

I think that it is critical that to save this file in the same folder as the .rmd file that you will use with the data.

R is sensitive to characters used filenames As downloaded, my Qualtrics .csv file had a long name with spaces and symbols that are not allowed. Therore, I gave it a simple, sensible, filename, ``ReC\_Download210319.csv''. An idiosyncracy of mine is to datestamp filenames. I use two-digit representations of the year, month, and date so that if the letters preceding the date are the same, the files would alphabetize automatically.

The focus of this chapter is to continue the process of scrubbing-and-scoring. We continue with the raw data we downloaded and prepared in the prior chapter. In this chapter we analyze and manage missingness, score scales/subscales, and represent our work with an APA-style write-up. To that end, we will address the conceptual considerations and practical steps in this process.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-1}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Recognize the key components of data loss mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), including how to diagnose MCAR.
\item
  Interpret missingness figures produced by packages such as \emph{mice}.
\item
  Articulate a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.
\item
  Use critical data manipulation functions from \emph{dplyr} including \emph{filter()}, \emph{select()}, and \emph{mutate()} to prepare variables.
\item
  Interpret code related to missingness (i.e., ``is.na'', ``!is.na'') and the pipe (\%\textgreater\%)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-1}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-1}}

The suggestions for practice continue from the prior chapter. The assignment in the prior chapter involved downloading a dataset from Qualtrics and the ``scrubbing'' it on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using that same data, the practice suggestions in this chapter will continue to use Parent's \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} AIA approach to managing missing data, to score the variables of interest. Options of graded complexity could incude:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written.
\item
  Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose.
\item
  Begin with raw data to which you have access.

The research vignette comes from the survey titled, \href{https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU}{Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise} and is explained in the prior chapter. In the prior chapter we conducted super-preliminary scrubbing of variables that will allow us to examine the respondent's perceived campus climate for students who are Black, predicted by the the respondent's own campus belonging, and also the \emph{structural diversity} proportions of Black students in the classroom and the BIPOC instructional staff. At present, I see this as a parallel mediation. That is, the perceived campus climate for Black students will be predicted by the respondent's sense of belonging, through the proportion of Black classmates and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color)instructional staff.

\emph{I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the \%Black instructional staff. At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the staff to model this.}

First, though, let's take a more conceptual look at issues regarding missing data. We'll come back to details of the survey as we work with it.

\section{On Missing Data}\label{on-missing-data}}

On the topic of missing data, we follow the traditions in most textbooks. We start by considering \emph{data loss mechanisms} and options for \emph{managing missingness.}

Although the workflow I recommend is fairly straightforward, the topic is not. Quantitative psychologist have produced volumes of research that supports and refutes all of these issues in detail. An in-deth review of this is found in Enders' \citeyearpar{enders_applied_2010} text.

\hypertarget{data-loss-mechanisms}{%
\subsection{Data Loss Mechanisms}\label{data-loss-mechanisms}}

We generally classify missingess in data in three different ways \citep{kline_principles_2016, parent_handling_2013}:

\textbf{Missing completely at random (MCAR)} is the ideal case (and often unrealistic in actual data). For variable \emph{Y} this mean that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Missingness is due to a factor(s) completely unrelated to the missing data. Stated another way:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Missing observations differ from the observed scores only by chance; that is, whether scores on Y are missing or not missing is unrelated to \emph{Y} itself
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The presence versus absence of data on \emph{Y} is unrelated to all other variables in the dataset. That is, the nonmissing data are just a random sample of scores that the researcher would have analyzed had the data been complete. We might think of it as \emph{haphazard} missing.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A respondent is interrupted, looks up, looks down, and skips an item.
  \item
    A computer glitch causes spotty missingness -- unrelated to any particular variable.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

MCAR is the ideal state because results from it should not be biased as a function of the missingness.

\textbf{Missing at random (MAR)} missing data arise from a process that is both measured and predictable in a particular sample. \emph{Admittedly the use of ``random'' in this term is odd, because, by definition, the missingness is not random.}

Restated:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Missingness on Y is unrelated to Y itself, but
\item
  Missingness is on Y is correlated with other variables in the data set.
\end{enumerate}

Example: Men are less likely to respond to questions about mental health than women, but among men, the probability of responding is unrelated to their true mental health status.

Kline \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016} indicated that information loss due to MAR is potentially recoverable through imputation where missing scores are replaced by predicted scores. The predicted scores are generated from other variables in the data set that predict missingness on Y. If the strength of that prediction is reasonably strong, then results on Y after imputation may be relatively unbiased. In this sense, the MAR pattern is described as \emph{ignorable} with regard to potential bias. Two types of variables can be used to predict the missing data

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  variables that are in the prediction equation, and
\item
  \emph{auxiliary} variables (i.e., variables in the dataset that are not in the prediction equation).
\end{enumerate}

Parent \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} noted that multiple imputation and expectation maximization have frequently been used to manage missingness in MAR circumstances.

\textbf{Missing not at random (MNAR)} is when the presence versus absence of scores on \emph{Y} depend on \emph{Y} itself. This is \emph{non-ignorable}.

For example, if a patient drops out of a medical RCT because there are unpleasant side effects from the treatment, this discomfort is not measured, but the data is missing due to a process that is unknown in a particular data set. Results based on \emph{complete cases only} can be severely biased when the data loss pattern is MNAR. That is, a treatment may look more beneficial than it really is if data from patients who were unable to tolerate the treatment are lost.

Parent \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} described MNAR a little differently -- but emphasized that the systematic missingness would be related to a variable outside the datset. Parent provided the example of items written in a manner that may be inappropriate for some participants (e.g., asking women about a relationship with their boyfriend/husband, when the woman might be in same gender relationship). If there were not demographic items that could identify the bias, this would be MNAR. Parent strongly advises researchers to carefully proofread and pilot surveys to avoid MNAR circumstances.

Kline \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016} noted that the choice of the method to deal with the incomplete records can make a difference in the results, and should be made carefully.

\hypertarget{diagnosing-missing-data-mechanisms}{%
\subsection{Diagnosing Missing Data Mechanisms}\label{diagnosing-missing-data-mechanisms}}

The bad news is that we never really know (with certainty) the type of missing data mechanism in our data. The following tools can help understand the mechanisms that contribute to missingness.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Missing data analyses often includes correlations that could predict missingness.
\item
  Little and Rubin \citeyearpar{little_statistical_2002} proposed a multivariate statistical test of the MCAR assumption that simultaneously compares complete versus incomplete cases on \emph{Y} across all other variables. If this comparison is significant, then the MCAR hypothesis is rejected.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To restate: we want a non-significant result; and we use the sometimes-backwards-sounding NHST (null hypothesis significance testing) language, ``MCAR cannot be rejected.''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  MCAR can also be examined through a series of \emph{t} tests of the cases that have missing scores on Y with cases that have complete records on other variables. Unfortunately, sample sizes contribute to problems with interpretation. With low samples, they are underpowered; in large samples they can flag trivial differences.
\end{itemize}

If MCAR is rejected, we are never sure whether the data loss mechanism is MAR or MNAR. There is no magical statistical ``fix.'' Kline \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016} wrote, ``About the best that can be done is to understand the nature of the underlying data loss pattern and accordingly modify your interpretation of the results'' (p.~85).

\hypertarget{managing-missing-data}{%
\subsection{Managing Missing Data}\label{managing-missing-data}}

There are a number of approaches to managing missing data. Here is a summary of the ones most commonly used.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Listwise deletion} (aka, Complete Case Analysis) If there is a missing score on any variable, that case is excluded from \textbf{all}
  analyses.
\item
  \textbf{Pairwise deletion} Cases are excluded only if they have missing data on variables involved in a particular analysis. AIA is a variant of pair-wise deletion, but it preserves as much data as possible with person-mean imputation at the scale level.
\item
  \textbf{Mean/median substitution} Mean/median substitution replaces missing values with the mean/median of that particular variable. While this preserves the mean of the dataset, it can cause bias by decreasing variance. For example, if you have a column that has substantial of missingness and you replace each value with the same, fixed, mean, the variability of that variable has just been reduced. A variation on this is a \textbf{group-mean substitution} where the missing score in a particular group (e.g., women) is replaced by the group mean.
\item
  \textbf{Full information maximum likelihood (FIML)} A \emph{model-based method} that takes the researcher's model as the starting point. The procedure partitions the cases in a raw data file into subsets, each with the same pattern of missing observations, including none (complete cases). Statistical information (e.g., means, variances) is extracted from each subset so all case are retained in the analysis. Parameters for the researcher's model are estimated after combining all available information over the subsets of cases.
\item
  \textbf{Multiple imputation} A \emph{data based method} that works with the whole raw data file (not just with the observed variables that comprise the researcher's model). Multiple imputation assumes that data are MAR (remember, MCAR is the more prestigious one). This means that researchers assume that missing values can be replaced by predictions derived from the observable portion fo the dataset.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Multiple datasets (often 5 to 20) are created where missing values are replaced via a randomized process (so the same missing value {[}item 4 for person A{]} will likely have different values for each dataset).
  \item
    The desired anlayis(es) is conducted simultaneously/separately for each of the imputed sets (so if you imputed 5 sets and wanted a linear regression, you get 5 linear regressions).
  \item
    A \emph{pooled analysis} uses the point estimates and the standard errors to provide a single result that represents the analysis.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{available-information-analysis-aia}{%
\subsection{Available Information Analysis (AIA)}\label{available-information-analysis-aia}}

Parent \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} has created a set of recommendations that help us create a streamlined workflow for managing missing data. After evaluating three approaches to managing missingness (AIA, mean substitution, and multiple imputation) Parent concluded that in datasets with (a) low levels of missingness, (b) a reasonable sample size, and (c) adequate internal reliability of measures, these approaches had similar results.

Further, in simulation studies where there was (a) low sample size (\emph{n} = 50), (b) weak associations among items, and (c) a small number of missing items, AIA was equivalent to multiple imputation. Even in cases where the data conditions were the ``best'' (i.e., \emph{N} = 200, moderate correlations, at least 10 items), even 10\% missingness (overall) did not produce notable difference among the methods. That is, means, standard errors, and alphas were similar across the methods (AIA, mean substitution, multiple imputation).

AIA is an older method of handling missing data that, as its name suggests, uses the \emph{available data} for analysis and excludes missing data points only for analyses in which the missing data point would be directly involved. This means

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the case of research that uses multiple item scales, and analysis takes place at the scale level

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    AIA is used to generate \textbf{mean} scores for the scale using the available data without substituting or imputing values;
  \item
    This method generally produces a fairly complete set of scale-level data where

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      pairwise deletion (the whole row/case/person is skipped) can be used where there will be multiple analyses using statistics (e.g., correlations, t-tests, ANOVA) were missingness is not permitted
    \item
      FIML can be specified in path analysisand CFA/SEM (where item-level data is required), and
    \item
      some statistics, such as principal components analysis and principal axis factoring (item-level analyses) permit missing data,
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Of course, the researcher could still impute data, but why\ldots{}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Parent's \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} recommendations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Scale scores should be first calculated as a \emph{mean} (average) not a sum. Why?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Calculating a ``sum'' from available data will result in automatically lower scores in cases where there is missingness.
  \item
    If a sum is required (i.e., because you want to interpret some clinical level of something), calculate the mean first, do the analyses, then transform the results back into the whole-scale equivalent (multiply the mean by the number of items) for any interpretation.
  \item
    For R script, do not write the script ({[}item1 + item2 + item3{]}/3) because this will return an empty entry for participants missing data (same problem as if you were to use sum). There are several functions for properly computing a mean; I will demo the \emph{mean\_n()} function from \emph{sjstats} package because it allows us to simultaneously specify the tolerance level (next item).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Determine your \emph{tolerance} for missingness (20\% seems to be common, although you could also look for guidance in the test manual/article). Then

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Run a ``percent missingness'' check on the level of analysis (i.e., total score, scale, or subscale) you are using. If you are using a total scale score, then check to see what percent is missing across all the items in the whole scale. In contrast, if you are looking at subscales, run the percent missing at that level.
  \item
    Parent \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} advised that the tolerance levels should be made mindfully. A four-item scale with one item missing, won't meet the 80\% threshold, so it may make sense to set a 75\% threshold for this scale.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  ``Clearly and concisely detail the level of missingness'' in papers \citep[p.~595]{parent_handling_2013}. This includes

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    tolerance level for missing data by scale or subscale (e.g., 80\% or 75\%)
  \item
    the number of missing values out of all data points on that scale for all participants and the maximum by participant (e.g., ``For Scale X, a total of \# missing data points out of \#\#\# were observed with no participant missing more than a single point.'')
  \item
    verify a manual inspection of missing data for obvious patterns (e.g., abnormally high missing rates for only one or two items). This can be accomplished by requesting frequency output for the items and checking the nonmissing data points for each scale, ensuring there are no abnormal spikes in missingness (looking for MNAR).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Curiously, Parent \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} does not recommend that we run all the diagnostic tests. However, because recent reviewers have required them of me, I will demonstrate a series of them.
\item
  Reducing missingness starts at the survey design -- make sure that all people can answer all items (i.e,. relationship-related items may contain heterosexist assumptions\ldots which would result in an MNAR circumstance)
\end{itemize}

Very practically speaking, Parent's \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} recommendations follow us through the entire data analysis process.

\hypertarget{working-the-problem-1}{%
\section{Working the Problem}\label{working-the-problem-1}}

In the prior chapter we imported the data from Qualtrics and applied the broadest levels of inclusion (e.g., the course rated was offered from an institution in the U.S., the respondent consented to participation) and exclusion (e.g., the survey was not a preview). We then downsized the survey to include the variables we will use in our statistical model. We then saved the data in a .csv file.

Presuming that you are working along with me in an .rmd file, if you have placed that file in the same folder as this .rmd file, the following code should read the data into your environment.

I use \emph{different} names for the object/df in my R environment than I use for the filename that holds the data on my computer. Why? I don't want to accidentally overwrite this precious ``source'' of data.

Let's think about how the variables in our model should be measured:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  DV: Campus Climate for Black Students (as perceived by the respondent)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    mean score of the 6 items on that scale (higher scores indicate a climate characterized by hostility, nonresponsiveness, and stigma)
  \item
    1 item needs to be reverse-coded
  \item
    this scale was adapted from the LGBT Campus Climate Scale \citep{szymanski_perceptions_2020}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  IV: Belonging

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    mean score for the 3 items on that scale (higher scores indicate a greater sense of belonging)
  \item
    this scale is taken from the Sense of Belonging subscale from the Perceived Cohesion Scale \citep{bollen_perceived_1990}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Proportion of classmates who are Black

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a single item
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Proportion of instructional staff who are BIPOC

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    must be calculated from each of the single items for each instructor
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Our next step is to conduct a preliminary missing data analysis at the item level, across the dataset we are using. The Campus Climate and Belonging scales are traditional in the sense that they have items that we sum. The variable representing proportion of classmates who are Black is a single item. The variable representing the proportion of instructional staff who are BIPOC must be calculated in a manner that takes into consideration the there may be multiple instructors. The survey allowed a respondent to name up to 10 instructors.

Looking at the structure of our data, the iRace(1 thru 10) variables are in ``int'' or integer format. This means that they are represented as whole numbers. We need them to be represented as factors. R handles factors represented as words well. Therefore, let's use our codebook to reformat this variable as a an ordered factor, with words instead of numbers.

Qualtrics imports many of the categorical variables as numbers. R often reads them numerically (integers or numbers). If they are directly converted to factors, R will sometimes collapse across missing numbers. In this example, if there is a race that is not represented (e.g., 2 for BiMulti), when the numbers are changed to factors, R will assume they are ordered and there is a consecutive series of numbers (0,1,2,3,4). If a number in the sequence is missing (0,1,3,4) and labels are applied, it will collapse across the numbers and the labels you think are attached to each number are not. Therefore, it is ESSENTIAL to check (again and again ad nauseum) to ensure that your variables are recoding in a manner you understand.

One way to avoid this is to use the code below to identify the levels and the labels. When they are in order, they align and don't ``skip'' numbers. To quadruple check our work, we will recode into a new variable ``tRace\#'' for ``teacher'' Race.

Calculating the proportion of the BIPOC instructional staff could likely be accomplished a number of ways. My searching for solutions resulted in this. Hopefully it's a fair balance between intuitive and elegant coding. First, I created code that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  created a new variable (count.BIPOC) by

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    summing across the tRace1 through tRace10 variables,
  \item
    assigning a count of ``1'' each time the factor value was Black, nBpoc, or BiMulti
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Next, I created a variable that counted the number of non-missing values across the tRace1 through tRace10 variables.

\subsection{Missing Data Analysis: Whole df and Item level}\label{missing-data-analysis-whole-df-and-item-level}}

In understanding missingness across the dataset, I think it is important to analyze and manage it, iteratively. We will start with a view of the whole df-level missingness. Subsequently, and consistent with the available information analysis {[}AIA; \citet{parent_handling_2013}{]} approach, we will score the scales and then look again at missingness, using the new information to update our decisions about how to manage it.

With a couple of calculations, we create a proportion of item-level missingness.

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from 0\% to 36\%.

At the time that I am lecturing this, the the amount of missing is not so egregious that I want to eliminate any cases. That is, I'm willing to wait until after I score the items to make further decisions, then.

Because (a) I want to teach it and (b) it is quite likely that we will receive responses with high levels of missingness, I will write code to eliminate cases with \(\geq\) 90\%.

\end{Shaded}

To analyze missingness at this level, we need a df that has only the variables of interest. That is, variables like \emph{ID} and the \emph{prop\_miss} and \emph{nmiss} variables we created will interfere with an accurate assessment of missingness. I will update our df to eliminate these.

\hypertarget{analyzing-missing-data-patterns}{%
\subsection{Analyzing Missing Data Patterns}\label{analyzing-missing-data-patterns}}

One approach to analyzing missing data is to assess patterns of missingness.

Several R packages are popularly used for conducting such analyses. In the \emph{mice} package, \emph{md.pattern()} function provides a matrix with the number of columns + 1, in which each row corresponds to a missing data pattern (1 = observed, 0 = missing).

Rows and columns are sorted in increasing amounts of missing information.

The last column and row contain row and column counts, respectively.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#Using the package: mice}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(mice)}

\NormalTok{mice\_out }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{md.pattern}\NormalTok{(scrub\_df, }\AttributeTok{plot =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{rotate.names =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The table lets you look at each missing pattern and see which variable(s) is/are missing. The output is in the form of a table that indicates the frequency of each pattern of missingness. Because I haven't (yet) figured out how to pipe objects from this table into the chapter, this text may dier from the patterns in the current data frame.

Each row in the table represents a different pattern of missingness. At the time of writing, there are \emph{6} patterns of missing data. The patterns are listed in descending order of the least amount of missingness. The most common pattern (\emph{23} cases, top row) is one with no missing data. One cases (is missing three cells -- three of the items assessing the campus climate for Black students, and so forth. \emph{These numbers are not piped and subject to change.}

In general, the data patterns represented a haphazard patterns of responding \citep{enders_applied_2010}.

\hypertarget{missing-mechanisms}{%
\subsection{Missing Mechanisms}\label{missing-mechanisms}}

Remember Little's MCAR test. Recently it has a history of appearing, working with glitches, disappearing, and so forth. At the present time I cannot find a package that is working well. When I do, I will add this section.

\hypertarget{scoring}{%
\section{Scoring}\label{scoring}}

So let's get to work to score up the measures for our analysis. Each step of this should involve careful cross-checking with the \href{./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf}{codebook}.

\hypertarget{reverse-scoring}{%
\subsection{Reverse scoring}\label{reverse-scoring}}

As we discovered previously, in the scale that assesses campus climate (higher scores reflect a more negative climate) one of our items (Blst\_1, ``My \emph{institution} provides a supportive environment for Black students.'') requires reverse-coding.

To rescore:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a \emph{new} variable (this is essential) that is designated as the reversed item. We might put a the letter ``r'' (for reverse scoring) at the beginning or end: rBlst\_1 or Blst\_1r. It does not matter; just be consistent.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We don't reverse score into the same variable because when you rerun the script, it just re-reverses the reversed score\ldots into infinity. It's very easy to lose your place.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The reversal is an \emph{equation} where you subtract the value in the item from the range/scaling + 1. For the our three items we subtract each item's value from 8.
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

  \FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{rBlst\_1 =} \DecValTok{8} \SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ Blst\_1) }\CommentTok{\#if you had multiple items, you could add a pipe (\%\textgreater{}\%) at the end of the line and add more until the last one}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Per Parent \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} we will analyze missingness for each scale, separately.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We will calculate scale scores on each scale separately when 80\% (roughly) of the data is present.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    this is somewhat arbitrary, on 4 item scales, I would choose 75\% (to allow one to be missing)
  \item
    on the 3 item scale, I will allow one item to be missing (65\%)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  After calculating the scale scores, we will return to analyzing the missingness, looking at the whole df
\end{itemize}

The \emph{mean\_n()} function of \emph{sjstats} package has allows you to specify how many items (whole number) or what percentage of items should be present in order to get the mean. First, though, we should identify the variables (properly formatted, if rescoring was needed) that should be included in the calculation of each scale and subscale.

In our case, the scale assessing belonging \citep{bollen_perceived_1990, hurtado_effects_1997} involves three items with no reversals. Our campus climate scale was adapted from Szymanski et al.'s LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale \citep{szymanski_perceptions_2020}. While it has not been psychometrically evaluated for the purpose for which I am using it, I will follow the scoring structure in the journal article that introduces the measure. Specifically, the factor structure permits a total scale score and two subscales representing the college response and stigma.

\hypertarget{missing-analysis-scale-level}{%
\section{Missing Analysis: Scale level}\label{missing-analysis-scale-level}}

Let's return to analyzing the missingness, this time including the \emph{scale level} variables (without the individual items) that will be in our statistical model(s).

\begin{figure}
\centering

First let's get the df down to the variables we want to retain:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{scored }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{ (scrub\_df, iBIPOC\_pr, cmBlack, Belonging, ResponseBL, StigmaBL, ClimateBL))}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Before we start our formal analysis of missingness at the scale level, let's continue to scrub by eliminating cases that clearly won't remain. In the script below we create a variable that counts the number of missing variables and then creates a proportion by dividing it by the number of total variables.

Using the \emph{describe()} function from the \emph{psych} package, we can investigate this variable.

\begin{Shaded}

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across the 38 cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from 0\% to 33\%.

We need to decide what is our retention threshhold. Twenty percent seems to be a general rule of thumb. Let's delete all cases with missingness at 20\% or greater.

\begin{Shaded}

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across the 38 cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from 0\% to 33\%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20\% missing, the dataset analyzed included 35 cases.

With a decision about the number of cases we are going to include, we can continue to analyze missingness.

\hypertarget{revisiting-missing-analysis-at-the-scale-level}{%
\section{Revisiting Missing Analysis at the Scale Level}\label{revisiting-missing-analysis-at-the-scale-level}}

We work with a df that includes only the variables in our model. In our case this is easy. In other cases (i.e., maybe there is an ID number) it might be good to create a subset just for this analysis.

Again, we look at missingness as the proportion of

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  individual cells across the dataset, and
\item
  rows/cases with nonmissing data
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across the 38 cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from 0\% to 33\%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20\% missing, the dataset analyzed included 35 cases. In this dataset we had 0.95\% missing across the df; 94.29\% of the rows had nonmissing data.

Let's look again at missing patterns and mechanisms.

\hypertarget{scale-level-patterns-of-missing-data}{%
\subsection{Scale Level: Patterns of Missing Data}\label{scale-level-patterns-of-missing-data}}

Returning to the \emph{mice} package, we can use the \emph{md.pattern()} function to examine a matrix with the number of columns + 1 in which each row corresponds to a missing data pattern (1 = observed, 0 = missing). The rows and columns are sorted in increasing amounts of missing information. The last column and row contain row and column counts, respectively.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{ReC_MultMod_files/figure-latex/scale level missingness w mice-1.pdf}

At the scale-level, this is much easier to interpret. As I am lecturing the results today (the numbers will change) there are \emph{2} rows of data because there are only \emph{2} patterns of missingness. The most common pattern is non-missing data (\emph{n} = 26).

\hypertarget{is-it-mcar}{%
\subsection{Is it MCAR?}\label{is-it-mcar}}

As noted earlier, I cannot find an MCAR package. This is a placeholder for updating this portion of the lecture when one becomes readily available (and I learn about it)

\hypertarget{r-eady-for-analysis}{%
\subsection{R-eady for Analysis}\label{r-eady-for-analysis}}

At this stage the data is ready for analysis (data diagnostics). With the AIA approach \citep{parent_handling_2013} the following preliminary analyses would involve pairwise deletion (i.e., the row/case is dropped for that analysis, but included for all others):

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Ch02/wrkflow_AIAready.jpg}
\caption{An image of our stage in the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  data diagnostics

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    psychometric properties of scales, such as alpha coefficients
  \item
    assessing assumptions such as univariate and multivariate normality, outliers, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  preliminary analyses

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    descriptives (means/standard deviations, frequencies)
  \item
    correlation matrices
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

AIA can also be used with primary analyses. Examples of how to manage missingness include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ANOVA/regression models

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    if completed with ordinary least squares, pairwise deletion would be utilized
  \end{itemize}
\item
  SEM/CFA models with observed, latent, or hybrid models

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    if FIML (we'll discuss later) is specified, all cases are used, even when there is missingness
  \end{itemize}
\item
  EFA models

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    these can handle item-level missingness
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Hierarchical linear modeling/multilevel modeling/mixed effects modeling

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    While all data needs to be present for a given cluster/wave, it is permissible to have varying numbers of clusters/waves per case
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

All analyses were completed in R Studio (v. 1.4.1106) with R (v. 4.0.4).

\textbf{Missing Data Analysis and Treatment of Missing Data}

Available item analysis (AIA; \citep{parent_handling_2013}) is a strategy for managing missing data that uses available data for analysis and excludes cases with missing data points only for analyses in which the data points would be directly involved. Parent (2013) suggested that AIA is equivalent to more complex methods (e.g., multiple imputation) across a number of variations of sample size, magnitude of associations among items, and degree of missingness. Thus, we utilized Parent's recommendations to guide our approach to managing missing data. Missing data analyses were conducted with tools in base R as well as the R packages, \emph{psych} (v. 1.0.12) and \emph{mice} (v. 3.13.0).

Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from 0\% to 36\%. Across the dataset, 3.35\% of cells had missing data and 84.21\% of cases had nonmissing data. At this stage in the analysis, we allowed all cases with less than 90\% missing to continue to the scoring stage. Guided by Parent's \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} AIA approach, scales with three items were scored if at least two items were non-missing; the scale with four items was scored if it at least three non-missing items; and the scale with six items was scored if it had at least five non-missing items.

Across the 38 cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from 0\% to 33\%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20\% missing, the dataset analyzed included 35 cases. In this dataset we had 0.95\% missing across the df; 94.29\% of the rows had nonmissing data.

The focus of this chapter engage in \emph{data diagnostics}, that is, to evaluate the appropriateness of the data for the \emph{specific research model we are going to evaluate}. We are asking the question, ``Does the data have the appropriate characteristics for the analysis we want to perform?'' Some statistics are more robust than others to violations of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data. None-the-less, we must report these characteristics when we disseminate the results.

There is about 45 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional hour.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling}{Github site} that hosts the book.

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Conduct and interpret critical data diagnostics, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    alpha coefficients
  \item
    skew
  \item
    kurtosis
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Assess univariate and multivariate normality
\item
  Identify options for managing outliers and skewed data
\item
  Articulate a workflow for data preparation, including scrubbing, scoring, and data diagnostics
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-2}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-2}}

The suggestions from practice are a continuation from the two prior chapters. If you have completed one or more of those assignments, you should have started with a raw dataset and then scrubbed and scored it. This chapter will involve running basic data diagnostics. Options of graded complexity could incude:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written.
\item
  Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose.
\item
  Begin with raw data to which you have access.

The same workflow guides us through the Scrubbing, Scoring, and Data Dx chapters. At this stage we have

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  imported our raw data from Qualtrics,
\item
  scrubbed the data by applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
\item
  used Parent's available information approach {[}AIA; \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013}{]} for determining the acceptable amount of missingness for each scale, and
\item
  prepared variables and scored them.
\end{itemize}

We are now ready to engage in data diagnostics for the statistical model we will test.

\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-2}}

The research vignette comes from the survey titled, \href{https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU}{Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise} and is explained in the \protect\hyperlink{scrub}{scrubbing chapter}. In the \protect\hyperlink{score}{scoring chapter} we prepared four variables for analysis. Details for these are in our \href{./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf}{codebook}.

Variable recap:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Perceived Campus Climate for Black Students includes 6 items, one of which was reverse scored. This scale was adapted from Szymanski et al.'s \citeyearpar{szymanski_perceptions_2020} Campus Climate for LGBTQ students. It has not been evaluated for use with other groups. The Szymanski et al.~analysis suggested that it could be used as a total scale score, or divided into three items each that assess

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    College response to LGBTQ students (items 6, 4, 1)
  \item
    LGBTQ stigma (items 3, 2, 5)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Sense of Belonging includes 3 items. This is a subscale from Bollen and Hoyle's \citeyearpar{bollen_perceived_1990} Perceived Cohesion Scale. There are no items on this scale that require reversing.
\item
  Percent of Black classmates is a single item that asked respondents to estimate the proportion of students in various racial categories
\item
  Percent of BIPOC instructional staff, similarly, asked respondents to identify the racial category of each member of their instructional staff
\end{itemize}

As we noted in the \protect\hyperlink{scrub}{scrubbing chapter}, our design has notable limitations. Briefly, (a) owing to the open source aspect of the data we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent; (b) the items that ask respondents to \emph{guess} the identities of the instructional staff and to place them in broad categories, (c) we do not provide a ``write-in'' a response. We made these decisions after extensive conversation with stakeholders. The primary reason for these decisions was to prevent potential harm (a) to respondents who could be identified if/when the revealed private information in this open-source survey, and (b) trolls who would write inappropriate or harmful comments.

As I think about ``how these variables go together'' (which is often where I start in planning a study), imagine a parallel mediation. That is the perception of campus climate for Black students would be predicted by the respondent's sense of belonging, mediated in separate paths through the proportion of classmates who are Black and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff.

\emph{I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the \%Black instructional staff. At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the staff to model this.}

I will finish up this chapter by conducting a regression. Because parallel mediation can be complicated (I teach it in a later chapter), I will demonstrate use of our prepared variables with a simple multiple regression.

First, though, let's take a more conceptual look at issues regarding missing data. We'll come back to details of the survey as we work with it.

\section{Internal Consistency of Scales/Subscales}\label{internal-consistency-of-scalessubscales}}

Alpha coefficients are \emph{reliability coefficients} that assess the \emph{internal consistency} of an instrument. It asks, ``For each person, are responses \emph{consistently} high, or medium, or low?'' To the degree that they are (meaning there are high inter-item correlations), the internal consistency coefficient will be high. We want values \textgreater.80. There are numerous problems with alpha coefficients. The biggest one is that they are influenced by sample size -- longer scales have higher alpha coefficients \citep{cortina_what_1993}. Fourteen seems to be a magic number where we begin to not trust the high alpha coefficient. I address this more thoroughly -- offering an alternative -- in psychometrics. While there is much criticism about the usefulness of the alpha coefficient \citep{sijtsma_use_2009}, researchers continue to use the alpha coefficient as an indicator of the internal consistency of scales that consist of multiple items and contain several variables.

We need item level data to compute an alpha coefficient. The easiest way to get an alpha coefficient is to feed the \emph{alpha()} function (\emph{psych} package) a contatonated list of items (with any items already reverse-scored). There should be no extra items. In the \protect\hyperlink{score}{scoring chapter} we already reverse-coded the single item in the campus climate scale, so we are ready to calculate alphas.

The df from which I am pulling data was created and written as an outfile in the \protect\hyperlink{score}{scoring chapter}. This particular df has item-level data.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

From this, we create tiny dfs, one for each of the alpha coefficients we need to create. A priori, we are planning to use all six items of the campus climate scale. We'll go ahead and also calculate the subscales because (a) it's good practice and (b) if the alpha is low, a \emph{reason} might show up in one of the subscales.

\subsection{Evaluating Univariate Normality}\label{evaluating-univariate-normality}}

Statistics like ANOVA and regression each have a set of assumptions about the distributional characteristics of the data. In most of the chapters in this OER we review those assumptions and how to evaluate them. Common across many statistics is the requirement of univariate and multivariate normality. Let's take a look at the variables we will use in our analysis and assess those.

We can continue to work from the df we uploaded at the beginning of the chapter to do this work. Let's take a quick peek. This df has the item-level data (we used it for the alpha coefficients); the scale and subscale scores; and the two items that assess proportion of instructional staff that are BIPOC and proportion of classmates that are BIPOC.

The \emph{str()} function let's us look at the variable format/measurement level of each variable.

To understand whether our data are normally distributed, we can look at skew and kurtosis. The skew and kurtosis indices in the psych package are reported as \emph{z} scores. Regarding skew, values \textgreater{} 3.0 are generally considered ``severely skewed.'' Regarding kurtosis, ``severely kurtotic'' is argued anywhere \textgreater{} 8 to 20 \citep{kline_principles_2016}. At the time I am writing this chapter, our skew and kurtosis values fall below the thresholds that Kline identified as concerning.

We can also apply the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality to each of our variables. When the \(p\) value is \textless{} .05, the variable's distribution is deviates from a normal distribution to a degree that is statistically significant. Below, the plotting of the histogram with a normal curve superimposed shows how the distribution approximates one that is normal.

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR THE APA STYLE WRITE-UP: Regarding the distributional characteristics of the data, skew and kurtosis values of the variables fell below the values of 3 (skew) and 8 to 20 (kurtosis) that Kline suggests are concerning \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016}. Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicate that our variables assessing the proportion of classmates who are Black (\(W\) = 0.806, \(p\) = 0.0000) and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff(\(W\) = 0.823, \(p\) = 0.0000) are statistically significantly different than a normal distribution. The scales assessing the respondent's belonging (\(W\) = 0.976, \(p\) = 0.5767) and the respondent's perception of campus climate for Black students (\(W\) = 0.934, \(p\) = 0.0376) did not differ differently from a normal distribution.

\emph{Note. Owing to the open nature of the dataset, these values will change. While I have used inline text to update the values of the Shapiro Wilks' and associated significance test, the text narration is not automatically updated and may be inconsistent with the results.}

What would we do in the case of a univariate outlier? I find Kline's \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016} chapter on data preparation and management to be extremely useful. He provides ideas for more complex analysis of both univariate and multivariate normality and provides suggestions that range from recoding an extreme value to the next most extreme that is within three standard deviations of the mean to more complicated transformations. First, though we need to further examine the relationships between variables. We do that, next.

\subsection{Pairs Panels}\label{pairs-panels}}

As we work our way from univariate to multivariate inspection of our data, let's take a look at the bivariate relations.

The \emph{pairs.panels()} function from the \emph{psych} package is useful for showing the relationship between variables (probably no more than 10) in a model.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

  The lower half is a scatterplot between the two variables with a regression line (red) and mean (dot).\\

\hypertarget{evaluating-multivariate-normality}{%
\section{Evaluating Multivariate Normality}\label{evaluating-multivariate-normality}}

\textbf{Multivariate outliers} have extreme scores on two or more variables, or a pattern of scores that is atypical. For example, a case may have scores between two and three standard deviations above the mean on all variables, even though no case would be extreme. A common method of multivariate outlier detection is the \textbf{Mahalanobis distance} (\(D_{M}^{2}\)). This indicates the distance in variance units between the profile of scores for that case and the vector of sample means, or \textbf{centroid}, correcting for intercorrelations.

The \emph{outlier()} function from the \emph{psych} package tells us how far each datapoint is from the multivariate centroid of the data. That is, find the squared Mahalanobis distance for each data point and compare it to the expected values of \(\chi^2\). The \emph{outlier()} protocol also produces a Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot with the \emph{n} most extreme data points labeled.

The code below appends the Mahalanobis values to the dataframe. It is easy, then, to identify, sort, and examine the most extreme values (relative to the rest of the data in their case/row) to make decisions about their retention or adjustment.

Numeric variables are required in the for the calculation of the Mahalanobis.

\includegraphics{ReC_MultMod_files/figure-latex/Detect multivariate outliers-1.pdf}

Q-Q plots take your sample data, sort it in ascending order, and then plot them versus quantiles (the number varies; you can see it on the X axis) calculated from a theoretical distribution. The number of quantiles is selected to match the size of your sample data. While Normal Q-Q Plots are the ones most often used in practice due to so many statistical methods assuming normality, Q-Q Plots can actually be created for any distribution. To the degree that the plotted line stays on the straight line (representing the theoretical normal distribution), the data is multivariate normally distributed.

It is possible, then to analyze the Mahalanobis distance values.

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR THE APA STYLE WRITE-UP: We evaluated multivariate normality with the Mahalanobis distance test. Specifically, we used the \emph{outlier()} function in the \emph{psych} package and included all continuous variables in the calculation. Our visual inspection of the Q-Q plot suggested that the plotted line strayed from the straight line as the quantiles increased. Additionally, we appended the Mahalanobis distance scores as a variable to the data. Analyzing this variable, we found that 0 exceed three standard deviations beyond the median. \emph{Thus, with no outliers, we assumed multivariate normality and proceeded with the data analysis} AS DATA IS ADDED THIS NUMBER OF OUTLIERS COULD UPDATE FROM ZERO AND THIS TEXT COULD CHANGE.

\hypertarget{a-few-words-on-transformations}{%
\section{A Few Words on Transformations}\label{a-few-words-on-transformations}}

To quote from Kline \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016}, ``Before applying a normalizing transformation, you should think about the variables of interest and whether the expectation of normality is reasonable.'' (p.~77)

At this point in history, the non-normal distribution of the proportions of classmates who are Black and instructional staff who are BIPOC are accurate representations in higher education. Kline \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016} has noted that transforming an inherently non-normal variable to force a normal distribution may fundamentally alter it such that the variable of interest is not actually studied. Kline's chapter reviews some options for applying corrections to outliers. Additionally, the chapter describes a variety of normalizing transformations.

On a personal note, while I will use stadardized scores (a linear transformation) if it improves interpretation and center variables around a meaningful intercept, I tend to resist the transformation of data without a really compelling reason. Why? It's complicated and can make interpretation difficult.

\hypertarget{the-apa-style-write-up-1}{%
\section{The APA Style Write-Up}\label{the-apa-style-write-up-1}}

Since the focus of this chapter was on data diagnostics, the APA style writeup will focus on on this element of the Method section:

\hypertarget{data-diagnostics}{%
\subsection{Data Diagnostics}\label{data-diagnostics}}

Data screening suggested that 52 individuals opened the survey link. Of those, 44 granted consent and proceeded to the survey items. A further inclusion criteria was that the course was taught in the U.S; 38 met this criteria.

Available item analysis (AIA; \citep{parent_handling_2013}) is a strategy for managing missing data that uses available data for analysis and excludes cases with missing data points only for analyses in which the data points would be directly involved. Parent (2013) suggested that AIA is equivalent to more complex methods (e.g., multiple imputation) across a number of variations of sample size, magnitude of associations among items, and degree of missingness. Thus, we utilized Parent's recommendations to guide our approach to managing missing data. Missing data analyses were conducted with tools in base R as well as the R packages, \emph{psych} (v. 1.0.12) and \emph{mice} (v. 3.13.0).

Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from 0\% to 36\%. Across the dataset, 3.35\% of cells had missing data and 84.21\% of cases had nonmissing data. At this stage in the analysis, we allowed all cases with less than 90\% missing to continue to the scoring stage. Guided by Parent's \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} AIA approach, scales with three items were scored if at least two items were non-missing; the scale with four items was scored if it at least three non-missing items; and the scale with six items was scored if it had at least five non-missing items.

Across the 38 cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from 0\% to 33\%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20\% missing, the dataset analyzed included 35 cases. In this dataset we had 0.95\% missing across the df; 94.29\% of the rows had nonmissing data.

Regarding the distributional characteristics of the data, skew and kurtosis values of the variables fell below the values of 3 (skew) and 8 to 20 (kurtosis) that Kline suggests are concerning \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016}. Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicate that our variables assessing the proportion of classmates who are Black (\(W\) = 0.806, \(p\) = 0.0000) and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff(\(W\) = 0.823, \(p\) = 0.0000) are statistically significantly different than a normal distribution. The scales assessing the respondent's belonging (\(W\) = 0.976, \(p\) = 0.5767) and the respondent's perception of campus climate for Black students (\(W\) = 0.934, \(p\) = 0.0376) did not differ differently from a normal distribution.

We evaluated multivariate normality with the Mahalanobis distance test. Specifically, we used the \emph{outlier()} function in the \emph{psych} package and included all continuous variables in the calculation. Our visual inspection of the Q-Q plot suggested that the plotted line strayed from the straight line as the quantiles increased.

Analyzing this variable, we found that 0 exceed three standard deviations beyond the median. \emph{Thus, with no outliers, we assumed multivariate normality and proceeded with the data analysis} AS DATA IS ADDED THIS NUMBER OF OUTLIERS COULD UPDATE FROM ZERO AND THIS TEXT COULD CHANGE.

Given that our sample sizes were reasonable for the planned analyses and the degree of missingness was low, we used pairwise deletion in our multiple regression analysis.

Results of a multiple regression predicting the respondents' perceptions of campus climate for Black students indicated that neither contributions of the respondents' personal belonging (\(B\) = 0.050, \(p\) = 0.684) nor the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff (\(B\) = -0.456, \(p\) = 0.312), nor the proportion of Black classmates (\(B\) = -0.015, \(p\) = 0.457) led to statistically significant changes in perceptions of campus climate for Black students. Although it accounted for 5.28\% of the variance, the overall model was not statistically significant. Results are presented in Table 2.

Multiple imputation is a tool for managing missing data that works with the whole raw data file to impute values for missing data for \emph{multiple sets} (e.g., 5-20) of the raw data. Those multiple sets are considered together in analyses (such as regression) and interpretation is made on the pooled results. Much has been written about multiple imputation and, if used, should be done with many considerations. This chapter is intended as a brief introduction. In this chapter, I demonstrate the use of multiple imputation with the data from the \href{https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU}{Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise} that has served as the research vignette for the first few chapters of this OER.

\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-3}}

There is about one hour of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be good to add another hour (to an hour-and-a-half).

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-3}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe circumstances under which multiple imputation would be appropriate
\item
  List and define the stages in multiple imputation.
\item
  Apply multiple imputation to a dataset that has missingness
\item
  Interpret results from a simple regression that uses multiple imputation
\item
  Articulate how multiple imputation fits into the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.
\item
  Write up the results of an the process of imputation from raw data through analyzing a simple regression (or similar) analysis.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-3}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-3}}

The suggestions for practice are a continuation from the three prior chapters. If you have completed one or more of those assignments, you should have worked through the steps in preparing a data set and evaluating its appropriateness for the planned, statistical, analysis. This chapter takes a deviation from the AIA \citep{parent_handling_2013} approach that was the focus of the first few chapters in that we used multiple imputation as the approach for managing missingness. Options, of graded complexity, for practice include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written.
\item
  Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose.
\item
  Begin with raw data to which you have access.
\end{itemize}

The following is a proposed workflow for preparing data for analysis.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Ch05/scrubscore_mimp_itemlvl.jpg}
\caption{An image of a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.}
\end{figure}

In this lecture we are working on the right side of the flowchart in the multiple imputation (blue) section. Within it, there are two options, each with a slightly different set of options.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  imputing at the item level

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    in this case, scales/subscales are scored after the item-level imputation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  imputating at the scale level

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    in this case, scales/subscales are scored prior to the imputation; likely using some of the same criteria as identified in the scoring chapter (i.e., scoring if 75-80\% of data are non-missing). Multiple imputation, then, is used to estimate the remaining, missing values.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Whichever approach is used, the imputed variables (multiple sets) are used in a \emph{pooled analysis} and results are interpreted from that analysis.

\hypertarget{research-vignette-3}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-3}}

The research vignette comes from the survey titled, \href{https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU}{Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise} and is explained in the \protect\hyperlink{scrub}{scrubbing chapter}. In the \protect\hyperlink{score}{scoring chapter} we prepared four variables for analysis. In the \protect\hyperlink{DataDx}{data diagnostics chapter} we assessed the quality of the variables and conducted the multiple regression described below. Details for these are in our \href{./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf}{codebook}.

Let's quickly review the variables in our model:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Perceived Campus Climate for Black Students includes 6 items, one of which was reverse scored. This scale was adapted from Szymanski et al.'s \citeyearpar{szymanski_perceptions_2020} Campus Climate for LGBTQ students. It has not been evaluated for use with other groups. The Szymanski et al.~analysis suggested that it could be used as a total scale score, or divided into three items each that assess

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    College response to LGBTQ students (items 6, 4, 1)
  \item
    LGBTQ stigma (items 3, 2, 5)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Sense of Belonging includes 3 items. This is a subscale from Bollen and Hoyle's \citeyearpar{bollen_perceived_1990} Perceived Cohesion Scale. There are no items on this scale that require reversing.
\item
  Percent of Black classmates is a single item that asked respondents to estimate the proportion of students in various racial categories
\item
  Percent of BIPOC instructional staff, similarly, asked respondents to identify the racial category of each member of their instructional staff
\end{itemize}

As we noted in the \protect\hyperlink{scrub}{scrubbing chapter}, our design has notable limitations. Briefly, (a) owing to the open source aspect of the data we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent; (b) the items that ask respondents to \emph{guess} the identities of the instructional staff and to place them in broad categories, (c) we do not provide a ``write-in'' a response. We made these decisions after extensive conversation with stakeholders. The primary reason for these decisions was to prevent potential harm (a) to respondents who could be identified if/when the revealed private information in this open-source survey, and (b) trolls who would write inappropriate or harmful comments.

As I think about ``how these variables go together'' (which is often where I start in planning a study), I suspect parallel mediation. That is the perception of campus climate for Black students would be predicted by the respondent's sense of belonging, mediated in separate paths through the proportion of classmates who are Black and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff.

\emph{I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the \%Black instructional staff. At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the instructional staff to model this.}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Ch04/BlStuMed.jpg}
\caption{An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data.}
\end{figure}

As in the \protect\hyperlink{DataDx}{data diagnostic chapter}, I will conclude this chapter by conducting a statistical analysis with the multiply imputed data. Because parallel mediation can be complicated (I teach it in a later chapter), I will demonstrate use of our prepared variables with a simple multiple regression.

\section{Multiple Imputation -- a Super Brief Review}\label{multiple-imputation-a-super-brief-review}}

Multiple imputation is complex. Numerous quantitative psychologists had critiqued it and provided numerous cautions and guidelines for its use \citep{enders_applied_2010, enders_multiple_2017, little_missing_2008, little_statistical_2002}. In brief,

\hypertarget{steps-in-multiple-imputation}{%
\subsection{Steps in Multiple Imputation}\label{steps-in-multiple-imputation}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Multiple imputation starts with a raw data file.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Multiple imputation assumes that data are MAR (remember, MCAR is the more prestigious one). This means that researchers assume that missing values can be replaced by predictions derived from the observable portion of the dataset.\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Multiple datasets (often 5 to 20) are created where missing values are replaced via a randomized process (so the same missing value {[}item 4 for person A{]} will likely have different values for each dataset).
\item
  The desired analysis is conducted simultaneously/separately for each of the imputed sets (so if you imputed 5 sets and wanted a linear regression, you get 5 linear regressions).\\
\item
  A \emph{pooled analysis} uses the point estimates and the standard errors to provide a single result that represents the analysis.
\end{itemize}

In a web-hosted guide from the University of Virginia Library, Katitas \citeyearpar{katitas_getting_2019} provided a user-friendly review and example of using tools in R in a multiple imputation. Katitas' figure is a useful conceptual tool in understanding how multiple imputation works. \emph{This figure is my recreation of Katitas' original.}

\includegraphics{images/Ch05/KatitasMimpFig.jpg}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the dataframe with missing data is the single place we start
\item
  we intervene with a package like \emph{mice()} to
\item
  impute multiple sets of data (filling in the missing variables with different values that are a product of their conditional distribution and an element of ``random'');

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``mids'' (``multiply imputed dataset'') is an object class where the completed datasets are stored.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  the ``with\_mids'' command allows OLS regression to be run, as many times as we have imputed datasets (in this figure, 3X). It produces different regression coefficients for each datset
\item
  the ``pool'' command pools together the multiple coefficients taking into consideration the value of the coefficients,the standard errors, and the variance of the missing value parameter across the samples.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{statistical-approaches-to-multiple-imputation}{%
\subsection{Statistical Approaches to Multiple Imputation}\label{statistical-approaches-to-multiple-imputation}}

\textbf{Joint multivariate normal distribution multiple imputation} assumes that the observed data follow a multivariate normal distribution. The algorithm used draws from this assumed distribution. A drawback is that if the data do not follow a multivariate normal distribution, the imputed values are incorrect. \emph{Amelia} and \emph{norm} packages use this approach.

\textbf{Conditional multiple imputation} is an iterative procedure, modeling the conditional distribution of a certain variable given the other variables. In this way the distribution is assumed for each variable, rather than or the entire dataset. \emph{mice} uses this approach.

\emph{mice}: multivariate imputation by chained equations

\hypertarget{working-the-problem-2}{%
\section{Working the Problem}\label{working-the-problem-2}}

Katitas \citeyearpar{katitas_getting_2019} claims that it is best to impute the data in its rawest form possible because any change would be taking it away from its original distribution. There are debates about how many variables to include in an imputation. Some authors would suggest that researchers include everything that was collected. Others (like me) will trim the dataset to include (a) the variables included in the model, plus (b) auxiliary variables (i.e., variables not in the model, but that are sufficiently non-missing and will provide additional information to the data).

In our case we will want:

Item for the variables represented in our model

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the item level responses to the scales/subscales

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    respondents' sense of belonging to campus (3 items)
  \item
    respondents' rating of campus climate for Black students (6 items)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  proportion of BIPOC instructional staff
\item
  proportion of classmates who are Black
\end{itemize}

Auxiliary variables -- let's choose four. One will be the format of the course. Three items will be from the course evaluation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  format, whether the course was taught in-person, a blend, or virtual
\item
  cEval\_1, ``Course material was presented clearly''
\item
  cEval\_13, ``Where applicable, issues were considered from multiple perspectives''
\item
  cEval\_19, ``My understanding of the subject matter increased over the span of the course''
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{selecting-and-formatting-variables}{%
\subsection{Selecting and Formatting Variables}\label{selecting-and-formatting-variables}}

There are some guidelines for selecting and formatting variables for imputation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Variables should be in their \emph{most natural} state
\item
  Redundant or too highly correlated variables should not be included

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you reverse coded a variable (we haven't yet), that's ok, but if you have already reverse-coded, then exclude the original variable
  \item
    Redundant variables (or multicollinear variables) may cause the multiple imputation process to cease
  \item
    Violation of this also provides clues for troubleshooting
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Exclude variables with more than 25\% missing
\end{itemize}

To make this as realistic as possible. Let's start with our very raw data. The \protect\hyperlink{scrub}{Scrubbing chapter} provides greater detail on importing data directly from Qualtrics. Therefore, I will repeat our protocol that imports the data and then scrubs it for our purposes. As described in the prior chapter, I named variables in Qualtrics to facilitate a more intuitive use in R.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(qualtRics)}
\NormalTok{QTRX\_df2 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ qualtRics}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{fetch\_survey}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{surveyID =} \StringTok{"SV\_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU"}\NormalTok{,}\AttributeTok{useLocalTime =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Next, I apply inclusion/exclusion criteria. As described in the \protect\hyperlink{scrub}{Scrubbing chapter} this includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  excluding all \emph{previews}
\item
  including only those who consented
\item
  including only those whose rated course was offered by a U.S. institution
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Preparing the data also meant renaming some variables that started with numbers (a hassle in R). I also renamed variables on the Campus Climate scale so that we know to which subscale they belong.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The Qualtrics download does not include an ID number. Because new variables are always appended to the end of the df, we also include code to make this the first column.

\begin{Shaded}

\subsection{Creating Composite Variables}\label{creating-composite-variables}}

Qualtrics imports many of the categorical variables as numbers. R often reads them numerically (integers or numbers). If they are directly converted to factors, R will sometimes collapse. In this example, if there is a race that is not represented (e.g., 2 for BiMulti), when the numbers are changed to factors, R will assume it's ordered and will change up the numbers. Therefore, it is ESSENTIAL to check (again and again ad nauseum) to ensure that your variables are recoding in a manner you understand.

Luckily, none of our variables have more than 25\% missing (\emph{or at least they didn't when I wrote this; the open nature of the survey and how it sources this chapter could change this}). If we did have a variable with more than 25\% missing, we would have to consider what to do about it.

Later we learn that we should eliminate case with greater than 50\% missingness. Let's write code for that, now.

\subsection{The Multiple Imputation}\label{the-multiple-imputation}}

Because multiple imputation is a \emph{random} process, if we all want the same answers we need to set a \emph{random seed.}

\begin{Shaded}

\FunctionTok{set.seed}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{210404}\NormalTok{) }\CommentTok{\#you can pick any number you want, today I\textquotesingle{}m using today\textquotesingle{}s datestamp}

\end{Shaded}

The program we will use is \emph{mice}. \emph{mice} assumes that each variable has a distribution and it imputes missing variables according to that distribution.

This means we need to correctly specify each variable's format/role. \emph{mice} will automatically choose a distribution (think ``format'') for each variable; we can override this by changing the methods' characteristics.

The following code sets up the structure for the imputation. I'm not an expert at this -- just following the Katitas example.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(mice)}
\CommentTok{\# runs the mice code with 0 iterations}

\end{verbatim}

This list (meth) contains all our variables; ``pmm'' is the default and is the ``predictive mean matching'' process used. We see that format (an unordered categorical variable) is noted as ``polyreg.'' If we had used other categorical variables (ordered/poly, dichotomous/log), we would have seen those designations, instead. If there is "" underneath it means the data is complete.

Our variables of interest are now configured to be imputed with the imputation method we specified. Empty cells in the method matrix mean that those variables aren't going to be imputed.

If a variable has no missing values, it is automatically set to be empty. We can also manually set variables to not be imputed with the \emph{meth{[}variable{]}=""} command.

The code below begins the imputation process. We are asking for 5 datasets. If you have many cases and many variables, this can take awhile. How many imputations? Recommendations have ranged as low as five to several hundred.

We need to create a ``long file'' that stacks all the imputed data. Looking at the df in R Studio shows us that when imp = 0 (the pe-imputed data), there is still missingness. As we scroll through the remaining imputations, there are no NA cells.

\subsection{Creating Scale Scores}\label{creating-scale-scores}}

Because our imputation was item-level, we need to score the variables with scales/subscales. As demonstrated more completely in the \protect\hyperlink{score}{Scoring chapter}, this required reversing one item in the campus climate scale:

Results of a multiple regression predicting the respondents' perceptions of campus climate for Black students indicated that neither contributions of the respondents' personal belonging (\(B\) = 0.004, \(p\) = 0.972) nor the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff (\(B\) = -0.287, \(p\) = 0.531) led to statistically significant changes in perceptions of campus climate for Black students. Results did suggest a statistically significant negative effect of the proportion of Black classmates on the campus climate for Black students. Specifically, as the proportion of Black students increases, there is less stigmatization and hostility on the campus (\(B\) = -0.018, \(p\) = 0.398). Results are presented in Table X.

Data screening suggested that 52 individuals opened the survey link. Of those, 44 granted consent and proceeded to the survey items. A further inclusion criteria was that the course was taught in the U.S; 38 met this criteria. Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from 0\% to 36\%. Across the dataset, 3.35\% of cells had missing data and 84.21\% of cases had nonmissing data. At this stage in the analysis, we allowed all cases with fewer than 50\% missing to be included the multiple imputation \citep{katitas_getting_2019}.

Regarding the distributional characteristics of the data, skew and kurtosis values of the variables fell below the values of 3 (skew) and 8 to 20 (kurtosis) that Kline suggests are concerning \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016}. Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicate that our variables assessing the proportion of classmates who are Black (\(W\) = 0.806, \(p\) = 0.0000) and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff(\(W\) = 0.823, \(p\) = 0.0000) are statistically significantly different than a normal distribution. The scales assessing the respondent's belonging (\(W\) = 0.976, \(p\) = 0.5767) and the respondent's perception of campus climate for Black students (\(W\) = 0.934, \(p\) = 0.0376) did not differ differently from a normal distribution.

We evaluated multivariate normality with the Mahalanobis distance test. Specifically, we used the \emph{outlier()} function in the \emph{psych} package and included all continuous variables in the calculation. Our visual inspection of the Q-Q plot suggested that the plotted line strayed from the straight line as the quantiles increased. Additionally, we appended the Mahalanobis distance scores as a variable to the data. Analyzing this variable, we found that 0 exceed three standard deviations beyond the median. \emph{Thus, with no outliers, we assumed multivariate normality and proceeded with the data analysis} AS DATA IS ADDED THIS NUMBER OF OUTLIERS COULD UPDATE FROM ZERO AND THIS TEXT COULD CHANGE.*

We managed missing data with multiple imputation \citep{enders_multiple_2017, katitas_getting_2019}. We imputed five sets of data with the R package, \emph{mice} (v. 3.13) -- a program that utilizes conditional multiple imputation. The imputation included the item-level variables that comprised our scales, the variables that represented proportion of BIPOC instructional staff and proportion of Black classmates, as well as four auxiliary variables (three variables from the course evaluation and the format {[}in-person/blended/virtual{]} of the class).

Results of a multiple regression predicting the respondents' perceptions of campus climate for Black students indicated that neither contributions of the respondents' personal belonging (\(B\) = 0.050, \(p\) = 0.684) nor the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff (\(B\) = -0.456, \(p\) = 0.312) led to statistically significant changes in perceptions of campus climate for Black students. Results did suggest a statistically significant negative effect of the proportion of Black classmates on the campus climate for Black students. Specifically, as the proportion of Black students increases, there is less stigmatization and hostility on the campus (\(B\) = -0.015, \(p\) = 0.457). Although it accounted for 5.28\% of the variance, the overall model was not statistically significant. Results are presented in Table 2.

\textbf{Some notes about this write-up}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I went ahead and used the data diagnostics that we did in the AIA method. It feels to me like these should be calculated with the multiply imputed data (i.e., 5 sets, with pooled estimates and standard errors), but I do not see that modeled -- anywhere in R.
\item
  Note the similarities with the AIA write-up.

  Character vectors (i.e., values that are represented with words) can be problematic. If they are causing trouble, consider

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    recode into factors,
  \item
    keep it in the df, but exclude it from the imputation protocol,
  \item
    our ``format'' variable was an ordered factor (i.e., each term was associated with a value), so I think that helped us avoid problems
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Variables with really high (like 50\% or more) proportions of missingness should be excluded.
\item
  Variables that are highly correlated or redundant (even if inverse) will halt the execution. If you set print=TRUE you will see where the algorithm is having difficulty because it will halt at that variable.
\item
  Variables with non-missing values can be problematic. If they are problematic, just exclude them from the process.
  *Width (columns/variables) versus length (rows/cases). You must have more rows/cases than columns/variables. It is difficult to say how many. If this is a problem:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Consider scoring scales first with AIA, then impute with whole scales.
  \item
    Divide the df in halves or thirds, impute separately, then join with the ID numbers.
  \item
    There should be auxiliary variables in each.
    *Item-level imputation is its ``whole big thing'' with multiple, complex considerations. There are tremendous resources
  \item
    Enders \href{http://www.appliedmissingdata.com/multilevel-imputation.html}{BLIMP} app is free and works with R
  \item
    Little's \citeyearpar{little_statistical_2002} article
  \end{itemize}
\item
  How many imputations? Controversial and has changed over the years.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Practical concern: the more you request, the longer it will take in R, this demo was 5
  \item
    For a number of years there was a push for 20, but I've also seen recommendations for 100s.
  \item
    Check examples of imputed studies in your disciplinary specialty/journals.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  There are lots of discussions and debates about

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    allowing for fractional/decimal responses (a 3.5 on 1 to 4 scaling; or a 0.75 on a dichotomous variable such as male/female)
  \item
    out-of-bounds estimates (what if you get a 7 on 1 to 4 scaling?)
  \end{itemize}

The focus of this lecture is to estimate indirect effects (aka ``mediation''). We examine the logic/design required to support the argument that \emph{mediation} is the \emph{mechanism} that explains the X --\textgreater{} Y relationship. We also work three examples (one with covariates).

At the outset, please note that although I rely heavily on Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} text and materials, I am using the R package \emph{lavaan} in these chapters. Very recently, Hayes has introduced a \href{https://www.processmacro.org/index.html}{PROCESS macro for R}. Because I am not yet up-to-speed on using this macro (it is not a typical R package) and because we will use \emph{lavaan} for confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, I have chosen to utilize the \emph{lavaan} package. A substantial difference is that the PROCESS macros use ordinary least squares and \emph{lavaan} uses maximum likelihood estimators.

\hypertarget{navigating-this-lesson-4}{%
\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-4}}

There is about 1 hour and 10 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional 1.5 hours.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, ocasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-4}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-4}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Define mediation and indirect effect.
\item
  Distinguish the role of a mediating variable from independent variables, covariates, and moderators.
\item
  Identify the conditions upon which there can be justification to support the presence of a mediated effect.
\item
  Articulate the arguments for and against using the term, ``mediation.''
\item
  Using the R package \emph{lavaan},

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    specify a model with indirect effects,
  \item
    identify and interpret B weights, \emph{p} values, and \emph{CIs} for total, direct, and indirect effects,
  \item
    calculate the total effects of X and M on Y,
  \item
    identify the proportion of variance accounted for in predicting M and Y.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Hand calculate the values of an indirect, direct, and total effects from statistical output or a figure (just the \(B\) or \(\beta\), not the significance level)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-4}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-4}}

The following suggestions for practice will involve specifying, testing, and interpreting a model with a single indirect effect (mediator).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rework the problem in the chapter by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data. This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar.
\item
  There are a number of variables in the dataset and there were a handful of simple mediations conducted in the journal article that sources the research vignette. Swap out one or more variables in the model of simple mediation and compare your solution to the one in the chapter and/or the research article.
\item
  Conduct a simple mediation with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{readings-resources-4}{%

In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s). Other resources are cited (when possible, linked) in the text with complete citations in the reference list.

\hypertarget{the-definitional-and-conceptual}{%
\subsection{The definitional and conceptual}\label{the-definitional-and-conceptual}}

As in Hayes text \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018}, we will differentiate between \emph{moderation} and \emph{mediation}. \emph{Conditional process analysis} involves both! With each of these, we are seeking to understand the \emph{mechanism} at work that leads to the relationship (be it correlational, predictive, or causal)

Even though this process has sometimes been termed \emph{causal modeling}, Hayes argues that his \emph{statistical approach} is not claiming to determine \emph{cause}; that is really left to the argument of the research design.

\textbf{Moderation} (a review):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Answers questions of \emph{when} or \emph{for whom} and is often the source of the answer, \emph{it depends}.
\item
  Think of our \emph{interaction} effects in ANOVA and regression
\item
  The effect of X on some variable Y is moderated by W if its size, sign, or strength depends on, or can be predicted, by W. Then we can say, ``W is a \emph{moderator} of X's effect on Y'' or ``W and X \emph{interact} in their influence on Y.''
\item
  The image below illustrates moderation with \emph{conceptual} and \emph{statistical} diagrams. Note that three predictors (IV, DV, their interaction) point to the DV.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/SimpleMed/ModConcStat.jpg}
\caption{Image of Hayes'style conceptual and statistical diagrams of a simple moderation}
\end{figure}

The classic plot of moderation results is often the best way to detect that an interaction was included in the analysis and helps understand the \emph{conditional} (e.g., for whom, under what conditions) nature of the analysis.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/SimpleMed/SimpleInteraction.jpg}
\caption{Image of classic interaction graph that illustrates a moderated effect. The IV is on the X axis, DV on the Y axis, and two intersecting lines represent the differential/moderated effect of the IV on the DV by the moderator}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Mediation}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Answers questions of \emph{how} (I also think \emph{through} and \emph{via} to describe the proposed mediating mechanism)
\item
  Paths in a mediation model are \emph{direct} (X does not pass through M on its way to Y) and \emph{indirect} (X passes through M on its way to Y). Once we get into the statistics, we will also be focused on \emph{total} effects.
\item
  Hayes thinks in terms of \emph{antecedent} and \emph{consequent} variables. In a 3-variable, simple mediation, X and M are the antecedent variables; X and M are the consequent variables.\\
\item
  There is substantial debate and controversy about whether we can say ``the effect of X on Y is \emph{mediated} through M'' or whether we should say, ``There is a statistically significant indirect effect of X on Y thru M.'' Hayes comes down on the ``use mediation language'' side of the debate.\\
\item
  In sum, a simple mediation model is any causal system in which at least one causal antecedent X variable is proposed as influencing an outcome Y through a single intervening variable, M. In such a model there are two pathways by which X can influence Y.
\item
  The figure below doubles as both the conceptual and statistical diagram of evaluating a simple mediation -- a simple indirect effect.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/SimpleMed/SimpleMed.jpg}
\caption{Image of Hayes'style conceptual diagram of a simple moderation}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Conditional process analysis}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Used when the research goal is to understand the boundary conditions of the mechanism(s) by which a variable transmits its effect on another.\\
\item
  Typically, simultaneously, assesses the influence of mediating (indirect effects) and moderating (interactional effects) in a model-building fashion.
\item
  In a conditional process model, the moderator(s) may be hypothesized to influence one or more of the paths.
\end{itemize}

We will work toward building a conditional process model, a moderated mediation, over the next several chapters.

}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{workflow-for-simple-mediation}{%
\section{Workflow for Simple Mediation}\label{workflow-for-simple-mediation}}

The workflow for a simple mediation is straightforward, however the figure below (i.e., the very traditional figure used to represent mediation) is very helpful in understanding the logic beneath mediation as the explanatory mechanism.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/SimpleMed/MedRationale.jpg}
\caption{Image of conditional process analysis model where the mediator is hypothesized to change the a path; the path between the IV and mediator}
\end{figure}

The top figure represents the bivariate relationship between the independent and dependent variable. The result of a simple linear regression (one predictor) represent the \emph{total} effect of the IV on the DV. We can calculate this by simply regressing the DV onto the IV. The resulting \(B\) weight is known as the \emph{c} path. A bivariate correlation coefficient results in the same value -- only it is standardized (so would be the same as the \(\beta\) weight).

The lower figure represents that the relationship between the IV and DV is \emph{mediated} by a third variable. We assign three labels to the paths: \emph{a}, between the IV and mediator; \emph{b}, between the mediator and DV; and \emph{c'} (c prime) between the IV and DV.

Statistically speaking, a mediated relationship is supported when the value of \emph{c'} is statistically significantly lower than \emph{c}. If this occurs, then we can say that the mediator is sharing some of the variance in the prediction of the DV.

You might already be imagining potential challenges to this model. For example, which variable should be the IV and which one should be the mediator? Can we switch them? You can -- and you will likely have very similar (if not identical) results. Good research design is what provides support for suggesting that mediation is the proper, casual, mechanism regarding the relationship between the IV and DV. An excellent review of the challenges of establishing a robust mediation model is provided by Kline \citeyearpar{kline_mediation_2015}, where he suggests the following as the minimally required elements of a mediation design:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the IV is an experimental variable with random assignment to conditions;
\item
  the mediator is an individual difference variable that is not manipulated and is measured at a later time;and
\item
  the DV is measured at a third occasion
\end{itemize}

These criteria are in addition to the rather standard criteria for establishing causality \citep[see][ for a review]{stone-romero_research_2010}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  temporal precedence,
\item
  statistical covariation, and
\item
  ruling out plausible rival hypotheses.
\end{itemize}

Some journals take this very seriously. In fact \href{https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-vocational-behavior/news/frequently-asked-questions-about-submitting-a-manuscript}{FAQs} in the Journal of Vocational Behavior make it clear that they will very rarely publish a ``mediation manuscript'' unless it has a minimum of three waves.

Working through a mediation will help operationalize these concepts.

The lavaan tutorial \citep{rosseel_lavaan_2020} provides a helpful model of how writing code to estimate an indirect effect. Using the lavaan tutorial as our guide, let's start with just a set of fake data with variable names that represent X (predictor, IV, antecedent), M (mediator, atencedent, consequent), and Y (outcome, DV, consequent).

\hypertarget{simulate-fake-data}{%
\subsection{Simulate Fake Data}\label{simulate-fake-data}}

The code below is asking to create a dataset with a sample size of 100. The dataset has 3 variables, conveniently named X (predictor, antecedent, IV), M (mediator), and Y (outome, consequent, DV). The R code asks for random selection of numbers with a normal distribution. You can see that the M variable will be related to the X variable by + .5; and the Y variable will be related to the M variable by + .7. This rather ensures a statistically significant indirect effect.

\subsection{Specify Mediation Model}\label{specify-mediation-model}}

The package we are using is \emph{lavaan}. Hayes' model is \emph{path analysis}, which can be a form of structural equation modeling. As a quick reminder, in SPSS, PROCESS is limited to ordinary least squares regression. We will use maximum likliehood estimators for the Hayes/PROCESS examples, but \emph{lavaan} can take us further than PROCESS because

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We can (and, in later chapters, will) do latent variable modeling.
\item
  We can have more specificity and flexibility than the prescribed PROCESS models allow. I say this with all due respect to Hayes -- there is also a good deal of flexibility to be able to add multiple mediators and covariates within most of the Hayes' prescribed models.
\end{itemize}

Hayes text is still a great place to start because the conceptual and procedural information is clear and transferable to the R environment.

Our atheoretical dataset makes it easy to identify which variable belongs in each role (X,Y,M). When specifying the paths in lavaan, here's what to keep in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Name your model/object (below is X, ``\textless-'' means ``is defined by'')
\item
  The model exists between 2 single quotation marks (the odd looking ' and ' at the beginning and end).
\item
  The \# of regression equations you need depends on the \# of variables that have arrows pointing to them. In a simple mediation, there are 3 variables with 2 variables having arrows pointing to them -- need 2 regression equations:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    one for the Mediator
  \item
    one for the DV (Y)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Operator for a regression analysis is the (tilde, \textasciitilde)
\item
  DV goes on left

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In first equation we regress both the X and M onto Y
  \item
    In second equation we regress M onto X
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The asterisk (*) is a handy tool to label variables (don't confuse it as defining an interaction); this labeling as a, b, and c\_p (in traditional mediation, the total effect is labeled with a and the direct effect is c'{[}c prime{]}, but the script won't allow and extra single quotation mark, hence c\_p) is super helpful in interpreting the ouput
\item
  The indirect effect is created by multiplying the a and b paths.\\
\item
  The ``:='' sign is used when creating a new variable that is a function of variables in the model, but not in the dataset (i.e., the a and b path).
\end{itemize}

After specifying the model, we create an object that holds our results from the SEM. To obtain all the results from our of indirect effects, we also need to print a summary of the fit statistics, standardized estimates, r-squared, and confidence intervals.

\emph{Other authors will write the model code more sensibly, predicting the mediator first, and then the Y variable. However, I found that by doing it this way, the semPlot produces a more sensible figure.}

Also, because we set a random seed, you should get the same results, but if it differs a little, don't panic.
Also, in Hayes text the direct path from X to Y is c' (``c prime''; where as c is reserved for the total effect of X on Y).

Let's run the whole model.

\subsection{Interpret the Output}\label{interpret-the-output}}

Note that in the script we ask (and get) two sets of parameter estimates. The second set (in the really nice dataframe) includes bootstrapped, bias-corrected confidence intervals. Bias-corrected confidence interals have the advantage of being more powerful and bias-free. Note, though, that when the CI crosses 0, the effect is NS.

So let's look at this step-by-step.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Overall, our model accounted for 40.96\% of the variance in the IV and 32.97\% of the variance in the mediator.
\item
  a path = 0.693, \(p\) = 0.000
\item
  b path = 0.764, \(p\) = 0.000
\item
  the indirect effect is a product of the a and b paths (0.693 * 0.764 = 0.529); while we don't hand calculate it's significance, we see that it is \(p\) = 0.000
\item
  the direct effect (c', c prime, or c\_p) is the isolated effect of X on Y when including M. We hope this value is LOWER than the total effect because this means that including M shared some of the variance in predicting Y: c' = -0.209, \(p\) = 0.062, and it is no longer signifcant.
\item
  we also see the total effect; this value is

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    identical to the value of simply predicting Y on X (with no M it the model)
  \item
    the value of a(b) + c\_p: 0.693(0.764) + -0.209 = 0.321 (\(p\) = 0.010)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Here's a demonstration that the total effect is, simply, predicting Y from X (also, the correlation between X and Y:

A simple mediation model examined the degree to which M mediated the relation of X on Y. Using the \emph{lavaan} package (v 0.6-7) in R, coefficients for each path, the indirect effect, and total effects were calculated. These values are presented in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1. Results suggested that 32.97\% of the variance in M and 40.96\% of the variance in Y were accounted for in the model. The indirect effect (\(B\) = 0.529, \(p\) = 0.000) was statistically significant; the direct effect (\(B\) = -0.209, \(p\) = 0.062) was not. Comparing the nonsignificant direct effect to the statistically significant total effect (\(B\) = 0.321, \(p\) = 0.010) is consistent with the notion that the effect of X on Y is explained through M.

\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-4}}

The research vignette comes from the Kim, Kendall, and Cheon's \citeyearpar{kim_racial_2017}, ``Racial Microaggressions, Cultural Mistrust, and Mental Health Outcomes Among Asian American College Students.'' Participants were 156 Asian American undergraduate students in the Pacific Northwest. The researchers posited the a priori hypothesis that cultural mistrust would mediate the relationship between racial microaggressions and two sets of outcomes: mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety, well-being) and help-seeking.

Variables used in the study included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{REMS}: Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Scale (Nadal, 2011). The scale includes 45 items on a 2-point scale where 0 indicates no experience of a microaggressive event and 1 indicates it was experienced at least once within the past six months. Higher scores indicate more experience of microaggressions.
\item
  \textbf{CMI}: Cultural Mistrust Inventory (Terrell \& Terrell, 1981). This scale was adapted to assess cultural mistrust harbored among Asian Americans toward individuals from the mainstream U.S. culture (e.g., Whites). The CMI includes 47 items on a 7-point scale where higher scores indicate a higher degree of cultural mistrust.
\item
  \textbf{ANX}, \textbf{DEP}, \textbf{PWB}: Subscales of the Mental Health Inventory (Veit \& Ware, 1983) that assess the mental health outcomes of anxiety (9 items), depression (4 items), and psychological well-being (14 items). Higher scores (on a 6 point scale) indicate stronger endorsement of the mental health outcome being assessed.
\item
  \textbf{HlpSkg}: The Attiudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help -- Short Form (Fischer \& Farina, 1995) includes 10 items on a 4-point scale (0 = disagree, 3 = agree) where higher scores indicate more favorable attitudes toward help seeking.

There are a number of reasons I love the Kim et al. \citeyearpar{kim_racial_2017} manuscript. One is that their approach was openly one that tested \emph{alternate models}. Byrne \citeyearpar{byrne_structural_2016} credits Joreskog \citep{bollen_testing_1993} with classifying the researcher's model testing approach in three ways. If someone is \emph{strictly confirmatory}, they only test the model they proposed and then accept or reject it without further alteration. While this is the tradition of null hypothesis significance testing, it contributes to the ``file drawer problem'' of unpublished, non-significant, findings. Additionally, the data are them discarded -- potentially losing valuable resource. The \emph{alternative models} approach is to propose a handful of competing models before beginning the analysis and then evaluating to see if one model is superior to the other. The third option is \emph{model generating}. In this case the researcher begins with a theoretically proposed model. In the presence of poor fit, the researcher seeks to identify the source of misfit -- respecifying it to best represent the sample data. The researcher must use caution to produce a model that fits well and is meaningful.

Several of the Kim et al. \citeyearpar{kim_racial_2017} models were non-significant. To demonstrate a model that is statistically significant, I will test the hypothesis that racial microaggressions (REMS, the X variable) influence depression (DEP, the Y variable) through cultural mistrust (CMI, the M variable).

I am a big fan of ``copying the model.'' In specifying my model I used our simple mediation template above

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  replaced the Y, X, and M with variables names
\item
  replacing the name of the df
\item
  updated the object names (so I could use them in the same .rmd file)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Overall, our model accounted for 8.94\% of the variance in the IV and 34.81\% of the variance in the mediator.
\item
  a path = 3.061, \(p\) = 0.000
\item
  b path = -0.220, \(p\) = 0.061
\item
  the indirect effect is a product of the a and b paths (-0.675); while we don't hand calculate it's significance, we see that it is \(p\) = 0.066; the bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals can sometimes be more lenient than \(p\) values; it is important they don't cross zero. They don't: CI95 -1.443 to 0.032\\
\item
  the direct effect (c', c prime, or c\_p) is the isolated effect of X on Y when including M. We hope this value is LOWER than the total effect because this means that including M shared some of the variance in predicting Y: c' = -0.732, \(p\) = 0.151, and it is no longer signifcant.
\item
  we also see the total effect; this value is
\item
  identical to the value of simply predicting Y on X (with no M it the model)
\item
  the value of a(b) + c\_p: 3.061(-0.220) + -0.732 = -1.406 (\(p\) = 0.000)

I make it a practice to immediately plot what I did. Because the plotting packages use our models, this can be a helpful self-check of our work.

For the purpose of the OER, and because it's good trainng, I also think it can be useful to make our own table. For me, it facilitates my conceptual understanding of (a) what the statistic is doing and (b) the results of our specific data.

\subsection{Results}\label{results-3}}

A simple mediation model examined the degree to which cultural mistrust mediated the relation of racial microaggressions on depressive symptoms Using the \emph{lavaan} package (v 0.6-7) in R, coefficients for each path, the indirect effect, and total effects were calculated. These values are presented in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1. Results suggested that 34.81\% of the variance in cultural mistrust and 8.94\%of the variance in depression were accounted for by the model. When the mediator was included in the model, bias-corrected confidence intervals surrounding the indirect effect (\(B\) = -0.675, \(p\) = 0.066, CI95 -1.443 to 0.032) were not quite statistically significant. Consistent with mediation, the value of the total effect was larger in magnitude and statistically significant (\(B\) = -1.406, \(p\) = 0.000, CI95 -2.133 to -0.722) than the smaller and non-significant direct effect (\(B\) = -0.732, \(p\) = 0.151, CI95 -1.697 to 0.293).

\section{Considering Covariates}\label{considering-covariates}}

Hayes Chapter 4 \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} considers the role of covariates (e.g., other variables that could account for some of the variance in the model). When previous research (or commonsense, or detractors) suggest you should include them\ldots its worth a try. If they are non-significant and/or your variables continue to explain variance over-and-above their contribution, then you have gained ground in ruling out plausible rival hypotheses and are adding to causal evidence.

They are relatively easy to specify in \emph{lavaan}. Just look at to where the arrows point and then write the path!

Let's say we are concerned that anxiety covaries with cultural mistrust and PWB We'll add it as a covariate to both.

\subsection{APA Style Write-up}\label{apa-style-write-up}}

There are varying models for reporting the results of mediation. The Kim et al. \citep{kim_racial_2017} writeup is a great example. Rather than copying it directly, I have modeled my table after the ones in Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} text. You'll notice that information in the table and text are minimally overlapping. APA style cautions us against redundancy in text and table.

\textbf{Results}

A simple mediation model examined the degree to which cultural mistrust mediated the effect of racial microaggressions on psychological well-being. Using the \emph{lavaan} package (v 0.6-7) in R, coefficients for the each path, the indirect effect, and total effects were calculated. The effect of covariate, anxiety, was mapped onto both the mediator and dependent variable. These values are presented in Table 3 and illustrated in Figure 3. Results suggested that 34.93\% of the variance in cultural mistrust and 34.93\% of the variance in well-being were accounted for by the model. Supporting the notion of a mediated model, there was a statistically significant indirect effect (\(B\) = -0.776, \(p\) = 0.016, CI95 -1.486 to -0.229) in combination with a non-significant direct effect (\(B\) = 0.131, \(p\) = 0.798, CI95 -0.854 to 1.158). Curiously, though, the total effect (\(B\) = -0.646, \(p\) = 0.083, CI95 -1.392 to 0.079) was also non-significant.

\hypertarget{residual-and-related-questions}{%
\section{Residual and Related Questions\ldots{}}\label{residual-and-related-questions}}

..that you might have; or at least I had, but if had answered them earlier it would have disrupt the flow.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Are you sure you can claim a significant indirect effect in the presence of a non-significant total effect? Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} is.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the section subtitled, ``What about Baron \& Kenny'' (chapter 4), Hayes argues from both logical/philosophical and statistical perspectives that the size of the total effect does not constrain or determine the size of the indirect effect. That is, an indirect effect can be different from zero even when the total effect is not (pp.~117-119).\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The output we get is different from the output in the journal article being used as the research vignette. Why? And should we worry about it?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We are simulating data. This gives us some advantages in that (unless we specify it), we never have missingness and our variables should be normally distributed. Because we are working from means, standard deviations, and correlations, our data will never be the same as the original researcher. That said, we can compare our results to the journal to \emph{check out work.} In fact, in this very chapter, I got turned around (e.g., first accidentally swapping the mediator and IV; then using the wrong DV) and was able to compare my work against the journal article to correct my errors.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Some of the statistics you are reporting are different than the ones in Hayes and the ones that use the PROCESS macro (e.g., what happened to the \emph{F} test)?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The default estimator for \emph{lavaan} is maximum likelihood (ML) and Hayes uses ordinary least squares (OLS). This affects both the values of coefficients, standard errors, AND the type of statistics that are reported.
  \item
    You can ask for OLS regression by adding the statement ``estimator =''GLS". Even with this option, I have not discovered a way to obtain the \emph{F} tests for the overall model. Researchers seem to be comfortable with this, even asking for less than we did (e.g., many do not request R square).
  \item
    Best I can tell, researchers who do want this might use a combination of packages, using GLS estimators in \emph{lavaan} (this easily gets them the bootstrapped CIs) and the move to a different regression package to get the intercepts and \emph{F} tests. If I did this I would triple check to make sure that all the output really lined up.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Why did we ignore the traditional fit statistics associated with structural equation modeling (e.g., CFI, RMSEA).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I hesitate to do this with models that do not include latent variables. Therefore, we asked for an ``in-between'' amount of info that should be sufficient for publication submission (any editor may have their own preferences and ask for more).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What if I have missing data?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When we enter the \emph{lavaan} world we do get options other than multiple imputation. In today's example we used the ``sem'' fitting function. Unless otherwise specified, listwise deletion (deleting the entire case when one of its variables is used to estimate the model) is the default in \emph{lavaan}. If data are MCAR or MAR, you can add the argument \emph{missing = ``ml''} (or its alias \emph{missing = ``fiml''}). More here \url{https://users.ugent.be/~yrosseel/lavaan/lavaan2.pdf} on the 1.7/Missing data in lavaan slide.
  \item
    That said, the type of estimator matters. If you estimate your data with GLS (generalized least squares) or WLS (weighted least squares), you are required to have complete data (however you got it). We used maximum likelihood and, even though we had non-missing data, I used the \emph{missing = ``fiml''} code.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-4}}

The three problems described below are designed to grow with the subsequent chapters on complex mediation and conditional process analysis (i.e,. moderated mediation). Therefore, I recommend that you select a dataset that includes at least four variables. If you are new to this topic, you may wish to select variables that are all continuously scaled. The IV and moderator (subsequent chapters) could be categorical (if they are dichotomous, please use 0/1 coding; if they have more than one category it is best if they are ordered). You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis.

The suggested practice problem for this chapter is to conduct a simple mediation.

If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation, then rework the problem. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar.

The focus of this chapter is the extension of simple mediation to models with multiple mediatrs. In these models with greater complexity we look at both parallel and serial mediation. There is also more elaboration on some of the conceptual issues related to the estimation of indirect effects.

\hypertarget{navigating-this-lesson-5}{%
\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-5}}

There is about 1 hour and 20 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional two hours.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-5}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-5}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Define \emph{epiphenomality} and explain how it is related to (and supports the notion of) multiple mediation.
\item
  Distinguish between parallel and serial mediation models.
\item
  Locate and interpret \emph{lavaan} output from multiply mediated models including
\item
  identifying coefficients,
\item
  percentage of variance accounted for,\\
\item
  all the effects (total, direct, indirec. total indirect),
\item
  contrasts.
\item
  Explain the limitations of the classic approach \citep{baron_moderator-mediator_1986} to mediation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-5}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-5}}

The suggestions for practice in this chapter include conducting parallel, serial, and/or mediation models. Options of graded complexity could incude:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rework the problem in the chapter by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data. This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar.
\item
  There are a number of variables in the dataset that sourced the research vignettes for this and the prior chapter on \protect\hyperlink{SimpleMed}{simple mediation}. Swap out one or more variables in a parallel or serial (or both) model.
\item
  Conduct a parallel or serial (or both) mediation with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{complex-mediation}{%
\section{Complex Mediation}\label{complex-mediation}}

The simple mediation model is quite popular, but also limiting in that it:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  frequently oversimplifies the processes we want to study, and
\item
  is likely mis-specified, in that there are unmodeled mechanisms.
\end{itemize}

Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} identified four reasons to consider multiply mediated models:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We are generally interested in MULTIPLE mechanisms
\item
  A mechanism (such as a mediator) in the model, might, itself be mediated (i.e., mediated mediation)
\item
  \emph{Epiphenomenality} (``unknown confounds''): a proposed mediator could be related to an outcome not because it causes the outcome, but because it is correlated with another variable that is causally influencing the outcome. This is a noncausal alternative explanation for an association.
\item
  Including multiple mediators allows formal comparison of the strength of the mediating mechanisms.
\end{itemize}

There are two multiple mediator models that we will consider: parallel, serial.

\hypertarget{parallel-mediation}{%
\section{Parallel Mediation}\label{parallel-mediation}}

\textbf{Parallel multiple mediation}: An antecedent variable X is modeled as influencing consequent Y directly as well as indirectly through two or more mediators, with the condition that no mediator causally influences another \citep[p.~149]{hayes_introduction_2018}

With multiple mediation we introduce additional effects:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Direct effect}, \(c'\) (this is not new) quantifies how much two cases that differ by a unit on X are estimated to differ on Y -- independent of all mediators.
\item
  \emph{Specific indirect effect}, \(a_{i}b_{i}\), the individual mediated effects
\item
  \emph{Total indirect effects }, \(\sum_{i=1}^{k}a_{i}b_{i}\) the sum of the values of the specific indirect effects. The total indirect effect can also be calculated by subtracting the direct effects from the total effects: \(c - c'\)
\item
  \emph{Total effect of X on Y}, \(c = c' + \sum_{i=1}^{k}a_{i}b_{i}\) (also not new) the sum of the direct and indirect effects. The total effect can also be estimated by regressing Y on X alone.
\item
  \emph{Contrasts} allow us to directly compare separate mediating effects to see if one indirect effect is stronger than the other.
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{images/CompMed/ParaMed.jpg}
In this parallel model, we can describe these effects this way:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Direct effect}: The effect of IV on the DV, accounting for two mediators (indirect effects) in the model.
\item
  \emph{Specific indirect effects}: There are indirect (or mediating) paths from the IV to the DV; through M1 and M2, respectively.
\item
  \emph{Total indirect effect of X on Y}: A sum of the value of indirect effects through the specific indirect effects (M1 and M2).
\item
  \emph{Total effect}: The sum of the direct and indirect effects. Also calculated by regressing Y (dependent variable) on X (independent variable) alone, without any other variables in the model.
\end{itemize}

Recall that for a complex mediation to be parallel, there can be no causal links between mediators. This is true in this example.

As before, let's work a mechanical example with simulated data that assures a statistically significant outcome. Credit to this example is from the PAULOTOFFANIN website \citep{toffanin_multiple-mediator_2017}.

\hypertarget{a-mechanical-example}{%
\subsection{A Mechanical Example}\label{a-mechanical-example}}

We can bake our own data by updating the script we used in simple mediation to add a second mediator.

Using what we learned in conducting a simple mediation in \emph{lavaan}, we can look at the figure of our proposed model and \emph{backwardstrace} the paths to write the code.

Remember\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The model exists between 2 single quotation marks (the odd looking ' and ' at the beginning and end).
\item
  You can write the Y as I have done in the R chunk below, or you can write the Y separately from each arrow, such as

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Y \textasciitilde{} b1*M1
  \item
    Y \textasciitilde{} b2*M2
  \item
    Y \textasciitilde{} c\_p*X
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Everything else transfers from our simple mediation, remember that

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the asterisk ("*") allows us to assign labels (a1, a2, b1, b2, etc.) to the paths; these are helpful for intuitive interpretation
  \item
    that eyes/nose notation (:=) is used when creating a new variable that is a function of variables in the model, but not in the dataset (i.e., the a and b path).
  \item
    in traditional mediation speak, the direct path from X to Y is c' (c prime) and the total effect of X to Y (with nothing else in the model) is just c.~Hence the c\_p label for c prime.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Something new: the \emph{contrast} statement (only one in this example, but you could have more) allows us to compare the indirect effects to each other. We specify it in the lavaan model, but then need to test it in a subsequent set of script.
\item
  \emph{Note}: In the online example, the writer adds code to correlate M1 and M2. This didn't/doesn't seem right to me and then, later, when we amend it to be a serial model, it made even less sense to have them be correlated.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{A note on indirect effects and confidence intervals}\label{a-note-on-indirect-effects-and-confidence-intervals}}

Before we move onto interpretation, I want to stop and look at both \(p\) values and confidence intervals. Especially with Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} PROCESS macro, there is a great deal of emphasis on the use of bootstrapped confidence intervals to determine the statistical significance of the indirect effects. In fact, PROCESS output has (at least historically) not provided \(p\) values with the indirect effects. This is because, especially in the ordinary least squares context, bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals are more powerful (i.e., they are more likely to support a statistically significant result) than \(p\) values.

An excellent demonstration of this phenomena was provided by Mallinckrodt et al. \citeyearpar{mallinckrodt_advances_2006} where they compared confidence intervals produced by the normal theory method to those that are bias corrected. The bias corrected intervals were more powerful to determining if there were statistically significant indirect effects.

The method we have specified in \emph{lavaan} produced bias-corrected confidence intervals. The \(p\) values and corresponding confidence intervals should be consistent with each other. That is, if \(p\) \textless{} .05, then the CI95s should not pass through zero. Of course we can always check to be certain this is true. For this reason, I will report \(p\) values in my results. There are reviewers, though, who may prefer that you report CI95s (or both).

There are a number of ways to tabalize the data. You might be surprised to learn that a number of articles that analyze mediating effects focus their presentation on those values and not the traditional intercepts and B weights. This is the approach I have taken in this chapter.

\emph{Note}. X =definition; M1 = definition; M2 = definition; Y = definition. The significance of the indirect effects was calculated with bias-corrected confidence intervals (.95) bootstrap analysis.

\hypertarget{apa-style-writeup}{%
\subsubsection{APA Style Writeup}\label{apa-style-writeup}}

A model of parallel multiple mediation was analyzed examining the degree to which importance of M1 and M2 mediated the relation of X on Y. Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} recommended this strategy over simple mediation models because it allows for all mediators to be examined, simultaneously. The resultant direct and indirect values for each path account for other mediation paths. Using the \emph{lavaan (v. 0.6-7)} package in R, coefficients for specific indirect, total indirect, direct, and total were computed. Path coefficients refer to regression weights, or slopes, of the expected changes in the dependent variable given a unit change in the independent variables.

Results (depicted in Figure 1 and presented in Table 2) suggest that 45.77\% of the variance in Y is accounted for by the model. While each of the specific indirect effects (X through M1 and M2, respectively) were statistically significant, the total indirect effect (i.e., the sum of the specific indirect effects was not. This is likely because the indirect effect passing through M1 was positive in valence and the indirect effect passing through M2 was negative; hence, they ``cancelled each other out.'' A pairwise comparison of the specific indirect effects indicated that the strength of the effects were statistically significantly different from each other (\(B\) = 0.509, \(p\) = 0.000). This means that the indirect effect passing through M1 was statistically stronger than the indirect effect passing through M2.

Let's turn now to the research vignette and work an example with simulated data from that example. Because the research vignette use an entirely new set of output I will either restart R or clear my environment so that there are a few less objects ``in the way.''

\hypertarget{research-vignette-5}{%
\subsection{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-5}}

The research vignette comes from the Lewis, Williams, Peppers, and Gadson's \citeyearpar{lewis_applying_2017} study titled, ``Applying Intersectionality to Explore the Relations Between Gendered Racism and Health Among Black Women.'' The study was published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology. Participants were 231 Black women who completed an online survey.

Variables used in the study included:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{GRMS}: Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale \citep{lewis_construction_2015} is a 26-item scale that assesses the frequency of nonverbal, verbal, and behavioral negative racial and gender slights experienced by Black women. Scaling is along six points ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (once a week or more). Higher scores indicate a greater frequency of gendered racial microaggressions. An example item is, ``Someone has made a sexually inappropriate comment about my butt, hips, or thighs.''
\item
  \textbf{MntlHlth} and \textbf{PhysHlth}: Short Form Health Survey - Version 2 \citep{ware_comparison_1995} is a 12-item scale used to report self-reported mental (six items) and physical health (six items).
  Higher scores indicate higher mental health (e.g., little or no psychological ldistress) and physical health (e.g., little or no reported symptoms in physical functioning). An example of an item assessing mental health was, ``How much of the time during the last 4 weeks have you felt calm and peaceful?''; an example of a physical health item was, ``During the past 4 weeks, how much did pain interfere with your normal work?''
\item
  \textbf{Sprtlty}, \textbf{SocSup}, \textbf{Engmgt}, and \textbf{DisEngmt} are four subscales from the Brief Coping with Problems Experienced Inventory \citep{carver_you_1997}. The 28 items on this scale are presented on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (\emph{I usually do not do this at all}) to 4(\emph{I usually do this a lot}). Higher scores indicate a respondents' tendency to engage in a particular strategy. Instructions were modified to ask how the female participants responded to recent experiences of racism and sexism as Black women. The four subscales included spirituality (religion, acceptance, planning), interconnectedness/social support (vent emotions, emotional support,instrumental social support), problem-oriented/engagement coping (active coping, humor, positive reinterpretation/positive reframing), and disengagement coping (behavioral disengagement, substance abuse, denial, self-blame, self-distraction).
\item
  \textbf{GRIcntlty}: The Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity Centrality subscale \citep{sellers_multidimensional_nodate} was modified to measure the intersection of racial and gender identity centrality. The scale included 10 items scaled from 1 (\emph{strongly disagree}) to 7 (\emph{strongly agree}). An example item was, ``Being a \emph{Black woman} is important to my self-image.'' Higher scores indicated higher levels of gendered racial identity centrality.
\end{itemize}

We note that our means and standard deviations map exactly onto those in the article. Because we asked for a normal distribution, we do not violate any of the assumptions related to univariate normality; our skew and kurtosis are well within the limits.

The pairs panel from the \emph{psych} package is an efficient way to see

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the distribution of each variable with a normal curve superimposed (on the diagonal)
\item
  the value of the bivariate correlation (upper diagonal)
\item
  a scatterplot with a regression line between each pair of variables (lower diagonal)

The Lewis et al.~article \citeyearpar{lewis_applying_2017} reports four mediation analyses, each repeated for mental and physical outcomes. Thus, their write-up reports eight simple mediation models. Graphically, this is efficiently represented in a figure that looks like parallel mediation. Note that the figure is reporting standardized estimates. In Hayes' \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} we have been using raw, \(B\) weights. However, the standardized weights are reported in the output.

\includegraphics{images/CompMed/LewisMedFig.jpg}
Because the figure looked like a parallel mediation, it made sense to me that we could try this in our research vignette. In the chapter on conditional process analysis, we will work the moderated mediation as they have done. Below is the model we will work. Specifically, we will evaluate whether gendered racial microaggressions impact mental health separately, thorough mediated paths of engagement and disengagement. We will also be able to see if the strength of those mediated paths are statistically, significantly, different from each other.

\emph{Note}. IV = gendered racial microaggressions; M1 = engagement coping; M2 = disengagement coping; Y = mental health. The significance of the indirect effects was calculated with bias-corrected confidence intervals (.95) bootstrap analysis.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The model accounts for 32.64\% of the variance in predicting mental health outcomes.
\item
  The total effect of GRMS on mental health is -1.362 (\(p\) = 0.000) is negative and statistically significant. That is, gendered racial microaggressions have a statistically significant negative effect on mental health.
\item
  The direct effect of GRMS on mental health is -0.575 (\emph{p} = 0.269) is still negative but not statistically significant.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Using Baron and Kenny's \citeyearpar{baron_moderator-mediator_1986} causal steps logic, the smaller and non-significant direct effect (compared to the total effect) provides helpful, logical support for mediation. According to Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} this difference is not necessary. However it is logically helpful.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Indirect effect \#1 (a1 x b1 or GRMS through engagement coping) is 0.118 (\(p\) = 0.000) and not statistically significant. Looking at the paths we see that \emph{a1} is positive and statistically significant (GRMS leds to increased engagement coping), but the next link, \emph{b1} (engagement to mental health) is not statistically significant.
\item
  Indirect effect \#2 (a2 x b2, or GRMS through disengagement to coping) is -0.905(\(p\) = 0.000). Gendered racial microaggressions lead to greater disengagement (\emph{a1}). In turn, disengagement has negative effects on mental health (\emph{b2})
\item
  The total indirect effect (i.e., sum of M1 and M2) -0.787 (\(p\) = 0.000 ) The sum of all specific indirect effects; statistically significant.
\item
  We look at the contrast to see if the indirect effects statistically significantly different from each other? \(B\) = 1.023, \(p\) = 0.000. They are. This is not surprising since the path mediated by engagement was not statistically significant but the path mediated by disengagement was statistically significant.

\subsubsection{APA Style Writeup}\label{apa-style-writeup-1}}

Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} provides helpful guidelines for presenting statistical results. Here is a summary of his recommendations.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pack as much statistical info as possible into a table(s) or figure (s).
\item
  Use statistics in the text as punctuation; avoid redundancy in text and table.
\item
  Avoid using abbreviations for variables in the text itself; rather focus on the construct names rather than their shorthand
\item
  Avoid focusing on what you hypothesized (e.g., avoid, ``Results supported/did not support hypothesis A1'') and instead focus on what you found. The reader is more interested in the results, not your forecasts.
\item
  Hayes uses unstandardized metrics. He prefers reporting unstandardized metrics because they map onto the measurement scales used in the study. He believes this is especially important when dichotomous variables are used.
\item
  There is ``no harm'' in reporting hypothesis tests and CIs for the a and b paths, but whether/not these paths are statistically significant does not determine the significance of the indirect effect.
\item
  Be precise with language:
\item
  OK: X exerts an effect on Y directly and/or indirectly through M.
\item
  Not OK: the indirect effect of M\\
\item
  Report direct and indirect effects and their corresponding inferential tests
\item
  Hayes argues that a statistically significant indirect effect is, in fact statistic. He dislikes narration of the Baron and Kenny \citeyearpar{baron_moderator-mediator_1986} process and steps.
\end{itemize}

Here's my attempt to write up the simulated data from the Lewis et al. \citeyearpar{lewis_applying_2017} article.

\textbf{Method}

Data Analysis

Parallel multiple mediation is appropriate when testing the influence of an independent variable (X) on the dependent variable (Y) directly, as well as indirectly through two or more mediators. A condition of parallel multiple mediation is that no mediator causally influences another \citep{hayes_introduction_2018}. Using data simulated from Lewis et al. \citeyearpar{lewis_applying_2017} we utilized parallel multiple mediation analysis to test the influence of gendered racial microaggressions (X, GRMS) on mental health outcomes (Y, MntlHlth) directly as well as indirectly through the mediators engagement coping (M1, Engmt) and disengaged coping (M2, DisEngmt). Using the \emph{lavaan} (v. 0.6-7) package in R we followed the procedures outlined in Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} by analyzing the strength and significance of four sets of effects: specific indirect, the total indirect, the direct, and total.

\textbf{Results}

\textbf{Preliminary Analyses}
Descriptive statistics were computed, and all variables were assessed for skewness and kurtosis. \emph{More narration,here.} A summary of descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix for the study is provided in Table \#. These bivariate relations provide evidence to support the test of mediation analysis.

\textbf{Parallel Multiple Mediation Analysis}
A model of parallel multiple mediation was analyzed examining the degree to which engagement and disengagement coping strategies mediated the relation of gendered racial microaggressions on mental health outcomes in Black women. Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} recommended this strategy over simple mediation models because it allows for all mediators to be examined, simultaneously. The resultant direct and indirect values for each path account for other mediation paths. Using the \emph{lavaan} (v. 0.6-7) package in R, coefficients for specific indirect, total indirect, direct, and total were computed. Path coefficients refer to regression weights, or slopes, of the expected changes in the dependent variable given a unit change in the independent variables.

Results (depicted in Figure \# and presented in Table \#) suggest that 32.64\% of the variance in mental health outcomes is accounted for by the three variables in the model. The indirect effect predicting mental health from gendered racial microaggressions via engagement coping was not statistically significant (\(B\) = 0.118, \(p\) = 0.000). Looking at the individual paths we see that \(a_{1}\) was positive and statistically significant (GRMS leds to increased engagement coping), but the subsequent link, \(b_{1}\) (engagement to mental health) was not. The indirect effect predicting mental health from gendered racial microaggressions through disengagement to coping was statistically significant (\(B\) = -0.905, \(p\) = 0.000). In this case, gendered racial microaggressions led to greater disengagement coping (\(a_{2}\)). In turn, disengagement coping had negative effects on mental health (\(b_{2}\)). Correspondingly, the total indirect effect (i.e., the sum of the specific indirect effects was statistically significant. A pairwise comparison of the specific indirect effects indicated that the strength of the effects were statistically significantly different from each other (\(B\) = 1.023, \(p\) = 0.000). Given that the path through engagement coping was not significant, but the path through disengagement coping was, this statistically signifciant difference is not surprising. Further support for understanding mediation as the mechanism of change is found in the drop in statistical significance from the total effect (\emph{c}) to the direct effect (\emph{c'}).

\textbf{Hints for Writing Method/Results Sections}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When you find an article you like, make note of it and put it in a very special folder. In recent years, I have learned to rely on full-text versions stored in my Zotero app.
\item
  Once you know your method (measure, statistic, etc.) begin collecting others articles that are similar to it. To write results sections I will often reference multiple articles.\\
\item
  When it iss time to write have all these resources handy and use them as guides/models.
\item
  Put as much info as possible in the table. Become a table-pro. That is, learn how to merge/split cells, use borders/shading, the decimal tab, and so forth. Don't make the borders disappear until the last thing you do before submitting. This is because you ALWAYS have to update your tables and seeing the borders makes it easier.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{serial-multiple-mediator-model}{%
\section{Serial Multiple Mediator Model}\label{serial-multiple-mediator-model}}

Recall that one of the conditions of the \emph{parallel mediator model} was that ``no mediator causally influences another.''

Regarding these correlated mediators \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Typically, two or more mediators that are causally located between X and Y will be correlated - if for no other reason than that they share a common cause (X).
\item
  Estimating the partial correlation between two mediators after controlling for X is one way to examine whether all of their association is accounted for by this common cause.
\item
  \emph{Partial correlation} is the Pearson correlation between the residuals from a model estimating Y from a set of covariates, and the residuals from a model estimating X from the same set of covariates.
\item
  Partial correlations allow the assessment of their association, independent of what they have in common with the covariates that were regressed onto Y and X, separately.
\item
  If two (or more) mediators remain correlated after adjusting for X, then
\item
  the correlation is \emph{spurious,} they share another (unmodeled) common cause.
\item
  the remaining association is \emph{epiphenomenal}. That is, a proposed mediator could be related to an outcome not because it causes the outcome, but because it is correlated with another variable that is causally influencing the outcome. This is a noncausal alternative explanation for an association. Also, many things correlated with the cause of Y will also tend to be correlated with X, but it doesn't make all those things cause Y
\item
  \emph{or one mediator causally affects another}
\end{itemize}

The goal of a serial multiple mediator model is to investigate the direct and indirect effects of X on Y while modeling a process in which X causes M1, which in turn causes M2, and so forth, concluding with Y as the final consequent.

As before, we will calculate:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Direct effect, c':} the estimated difference in Y between two cases that differ by one unit on X but who are equal on all mediators in the model.
\item
  \emph{Specific indirect effects, a1b1, a2b2, a3b3, etc.:} constructed by multiplying the regression weights corresponding to each step in an indirect pathway; interpreted as the estimated difference in Y between two cases that differ by one unit on X through the causal sequence from X to mediator(s) to Y.
\item
  \emph{Total indirect effect of X:} sum of all specific indirect effects
\item

Our parallel multiple mediator model of gendered racial microaggressions on mental health through engagement and disengagement coping strategies assumed no causal association between the mediators. Noting the statistically significant correlation between engagement and disengagement, what if engagement influenced disengagement, which, in turn influenced mental health.

If this is our goal (image), how many direct and indirect effects are contained in this model? Using the same processes as before, let's plan our model:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We add a path predicting disengagement from engagement, and label it with a \(d_{21}\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Regarding the notation, it makes sense that we use a \emph{d} to designate a new type of path; I don't know why we use a subscript of 21
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We specify a third indirect path that multiplies those 3 paths (a1, d21, b2) together
\item
  We add a third contrast so that we get all the combinations of indirect comparisons: 1-2, 1-3 2-3
\item
  We update our total\_indirects calculation to include indirect\#3
\item
  We update our total\_c calculation to include indirect\#3
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note}. IV = gendered racial microaggressions; M1 = engagement coping; M2 = disengagement coping; Y = mental health. The significance of the indirect effects was calculated with bias-corrected confidence intervals (.95) bootstrap analysis.

Working through the data, we should be able to find these items:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The model accounts for 31.04\% of the variance in predicting mental health outcomes.
\item
  The total effect of GRMS (X) on mental health (Y) is -1.362 (\(p\) = 0.000) is negative and statistically significant.
\item
  The direct effect of GRMS (X) on mental health (Y) (-0.575, \(p\) = 0.033) is still negative, but weaker in magnitude (relative to the total effect). While the \(p\) value is statistically significant, it is closer to being not significant (than the total effect). This reduction in magnitude and strength of significance is consistent with the Baron and Kenny \citeyearpar{baron_moderator-mediator_1986} logic of mediation.
\item
  Indirect effect \#1 (\(a_{1}\) x \(b_{1}\) or GRMS through engagement coping to mental health) is 0.118 (\(p\) = 0.235). Again, \(p\) is \textgreater{} .05. Examining the individual paths, there is a statistically significant relationship from GRMS to engagement, but not from engagement to mental health.
\item
  Indirect effect \#2 (\(a_{2}\) x \(b_{2}\), or GRMS through disengagement coping to mental health, is -0.726 (\(p\) = 0.000). Each of the paths is statistically significant from zero and so is the indirect effect.
\item
  Indirect effect \#3 (\(a_{2}\) x \(d_{21}\) x \(b_{2}\); GRMS through engagement coping through disengagement coping to mental health) is -0.180 (\(p\) = 0.000). This indirect effect involves \(a_{1}\) (GRMS to engagement) which is not significant. However, the remaining paths were significant. That is engagement coping led to increased disengagement coping, which led to poorer mental health outcomes.
\item
  Total indirect: -0.787 (\(p\) = 0.000) is the sum of all specific indirect effects and is statistically significant.
\item
  With \textbf{contrasts} we ask: Are the indirect effects statistically significantly different from each other?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Contrast 1 (indirect 1 v 2) = 0.844 (\(p\) = 0.000), yes
  \item
    Contrast 2 (indirect 1 v 3) = 0.844 (\(p\) = 0.022), yes
  \item
    Contrast 3 (indirect 2 v 3) = 0.844 (\(p\) = -0.546), yes
  \item
    This formal test of contrasts is an important one. It is not ok to infer that effects are statistically significantly different than each other on the basis of their estimates or \(p\) values. The formal test allows us to claim (with justification) that the strongest indirect effect is \#2 -- GRMS through disengagement coping to mental health.

\textbf{Method}
\textbf{Data Analysis}
Serial multiple mediation is appropriate when testing the influence of an independent variable (X) on the dependent variable (Y) directly, as well as indirectly through two or more mediators (M) and there is reason to hypothesize that variables that are causally prior in the model affect all variables later in the causal sequence \citep{hayes_introduction_2018}. We utilized serial multiple mediation analysis to test the influence of gendered racial microaggressions (X, GRMS) on mental health (Y, MntlHlth) directly as well as indirectly through the mediators engagement coping (M1, Engmt) and disengagement coping (M2, DisEngmt). Moreover, we hypothesized a causal linkage between from the engagement coping mediator to the disengagement coping mediator such that a third specific indirect effect began with GRMS (X) through engagement coping (M1) through disengagement coping (M2) to mental health (Y). Using the \emph{lavaan} (v. 0.6-7) package in R we followed the procedures outlined in Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} by analyzing the strength and significance of four sets of effects: specific indirect, the total indirect, the direct, and total. Bootstrap analysis, a nonparametric sampling procedure, was used to test the significance of the indirect effects.

\emph{Hayes would likely recommend that we say this with fewer acronyms and more words/story.}

\textbf{Results}
\textbf{Preliminary Analyses}
Descriptive statistics were computed, and all variables were assessed univariate normality. \emph{You would give your results regarding skew, kurtosis, Shapiro Wilks', here. If relevant, you could also describe multivariate normality.} A summary of descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix for the study is provided in Table 1. These bivariate relations provide evidence to support the test of mediation analysis.

\textbf{Serial Multiple Mediation Analysis}
A model of serial multiple mediation was analyzed examining the degree to which engagement and disengagement coping mediated the relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health outcomes. Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} recommended this strategy over simple mediation models because it allows for all mediators to be examined, simultaneously and allows the testing of the seriated effect of prior mediators onto subsequent ones. Using the \emph{lavaan} (v. 0.6-7) package in R, coefficients for specific indirect, total indirect, direct, and total were computed. Path coefficients refer to regression weights, or slopes, of the expected changes in the dependent variable given a unit change in the independent variables.

Results (depicted in Figure \# and presented in Table \#) suggest that 31.04\% of the variance in behavioral intentions is accounted for by the three variables in the model. Two of the specific indirect effects were significant and were statistically significantly different from each other. Specifically, the effect of gendered racial microaggressions through disengagement coping to mental health (\(B\) = 0.118, \(p\) = 0.235) was stronger than the indirect effect from gendered racial microaggressions through engagement coping through disengagement coping to mental health (\(B\) = -0.180, \(p\) = 0.000). Interpreting the results suggests that, mental health outcomes are negatively impacted by gendered racial microaggressions direct and indirectly through disengagement coping. It is this latter path that has the greatest impact.

\emph{Note}: In a manner consistent with the Lewis et al. \citeyearpar{lewis_applying_2017} article, the APA Results section can be fairly short. This is especially true when a well-organized table presents the results. In fact, I oculd have left all the numbers out of this except for the \(R^2\) (because it was not reported in the table).

\hypertarget{troubleshooting-and-faqs}{%
\section{Troubleshooting and FAQs}\label{troubleshooting-and-faqs}}

An indirect effect that was (seemingly) significant in a simple (single) mediation disappears when additional mediators are added.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Correlated mediators (e.g., multicollinearity) is a likely possibility.
\item
  Which is correct? Maybe both\ldots{}
\end{itemize}

A total effect was not significant, but there is one or more statistically significant specific indirect effect

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Recall that a total effect equals the sum of direct and indirect effects. If one specific indirect effect is positive and another is negative, this could account for the NS total effect.
\item
  If the direct effect is NS, but the indirect effects are significant, this might render the total effect NS.
\item
  The indirect effects might operate differently in subpopulations (males, females).
\end{itemize}

Your editor/peer reviewer/dissertation chair-or-committee member may insist that you do this the Baron \& Kenny way (aka ``the causal steps approach'').

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Hayes 4.1 \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} provides fabulous narration and justification for how to justify your (I believe correct) decision to just use the PROCESS (aka, bootstrapped, bias corrected, CIs )approach.
\item
  My favorite line in his text reads, " (the B\&K way).is still being taught and recommended by researchers who don't follow the methodology literature."
\end{itemize}

How can I extend a mediation (only) model to include multiple Xs, Ys, or COVs?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There is fabulous, fabulous narration and syntax for doing all of this in Hayes text. Of course his mechanics are in PROCESS, but \emph{lavaan} is easy to use by just ``drawing more paths'' via the syntax. We'll get more practice as we go along.
\end{itemize}

What about effect sizes? Shouldn't we be including/reporting them?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Yes! The closest thing we have reported to an effect size is \(R^2\), which assess proportion of variance accounted for in the M and Y variables.\\
\item
  In PROCESS and path analysis this is still emerging. Hayes chapter 4 presents a handful of options for effect sizes beyond \(R^2\).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{practice-problems-5}{%
\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-5}}

The three problems described below are designed to be grow in this series of chapters that begins with simple mediation and progresses through complex mediation, moderated moderation, and conditional process analysis. I recommend that you select a dataset that includes at least four variables. If you are new to this topic, you may wish to select variables that are all continuously scaled. The IV and moderator (in subsequent chapters) could be categorical (if they are dichotomous, please use 0/1 coding; if they have more than one category it is best if they are ordered). You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis.

The suggested practice problem for this chapter is to conduct a parallel or serial mediation (or both).

The focus of this lecture is the moderated mediation. That is, are the effects of the indirect effect (sign, significance, strength, presence/absence) \emph{conditional} on the effects of the moderator.

At the outset, please note that although I rely heavily on Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} text and materials, I am using the R package \emph{lavaan} in these chapters. Very recently, Hayes has introduced a \href{https://www.processmacro.org/index.html}{PROCESS macro for R}. Because I am not yet up-to-speed on using this macro (it is not a typical R package) and because we will use \emph{lavaan} for confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, I have chosen to utilize the \emph{lavaan} package. A substantial difference is that the PROCESS macros use ordinary least squares and \emph{lavaan} uses maximum likelihood estimators.

\hypertarget{navigating-this-lesson-6}{%
\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-6}}

There is about 1 hour and 15 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional hour and a half.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-6}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-6}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Outline a process of evaluating a moderated mediation in a piecewise \citep{hayes_introduction_2018} approach to model building
\item
  Recognize conditional process modeling from R script.
\item
  Using the R package \emph{lavaan},

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    specify a model with indirect effects,
  \item
    identify and interpret B weights, \emph{p} values, and \emph{CIs} for total, direct, and indirect effects,\\
  \item
    calculate the total effects of X and M on Y,
  \item
    identify the proportion of variance accounted for in predicting M and Y.
  \end{itemize}
\item

  \item
    Know the essential components of calculating an index of moderated mediation
  \item
    Probe a conditional indirect effect
  \end{itemize}
\item

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-6}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-6}}

The suggestions for homework are graded in complexity and, if you like, can extend from the prior chapter on simple moderation. If you choose the first or second options, you can further amend the simulated data by making further variations such as sample size.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rework the problem in the chapter by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data. This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar.
\item
  There are a number of variables in the dataset. Swap out one or more variables in the moderated mediation and compare your solution to the one in the chapter (and/or oe you mimicked in the journal article).
\item
  Conduct a moderated mediation with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conditional Process Analysis}\label{conditional-process-analysis}}

\hypertarget{the-definitional-and-conceptual-1}{%
\subsection{The definitional and conceptual}\label{the-definitional-and-conceptual-1}}

Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} coined the term and suggests we also talk about ``conditional process modeling.''

\textbf{Conditional process analysis}: used when the analytical goal is to describe and understand the conditional nature of the mechanism or mechanisms by which a variable transmits its effect on another.

We are integrating moderation and mediation mechanisms together into a single integrated analytical model.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Mediator}: Any causal system in which at least one causal antecedent X variable is proposed as influencing an outcome Y through a intervening variable M. In this model, there are two pathways by which X can influence Y: \emph{direct} effect of X on Y, and \emph{indirect} effect of X on Y through M.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Answers question, ``How does X affect Y''
  \item
    Partitions the X-to-Y relationship into two paths of influence: direct, indirect.
  \item
    Indirect effect contains two components (a,b) that when multipled (a*b) yield an estimate of how much these two cases that differ by one unit on X are estimated to differ on Y through the effect of X on M, which in turn affects Y.
  \item
    Keywords: how, through, via, indirect effect
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Moderator}: The effect of X on some variable Y is moderated by W if its size, sign, or strength depends on or can be predicted by W.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Stated another way, W and X \emph{interact} in their influence on Y.\\
  \item
    Moderators help establish the boundary conditions of an effect or the circumstances, stimuli, or type of people for which the effect is large v. small, present v. absent, positive v. negative, and so forth.
  \item
    Keywords: ``it depends,'' interaction effect.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why should we engage both mediators and moderators?} Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} suggest that if we have only a mediator(s) in the model that we lose information if we ``reduce complex responses that no doubt differ from person to person or situation to situation'' (p.~394). He adds that ``all effects are moderated by something'' (p.~394). Correspondingly, he recommends we add them to a mediation anlaysis.

Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} suggests that ``more complete'' (p.~395) analyses model the mechanisms at work linking X to Y (mediator{[}s{]}) while simultaneously allowing those effects to be contingent on context, circumstance, or individual difference (moderator{[}s{]}).

\textbf{What are conditional direct and indirect effects?}. Mediation analyses produce indirect (the product of a sequence of effects that are assumed to be causal) and direct (the unique contribution of X to Y, controlling for other variables in the model) effects. These effects (the X-to-Y/direct and X-to-M-to-Y/indirect), can also be moderated. This is our quest! Figure 11.2 in Hayes' text \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} illustrates conceptually and statistically that we can specify moderation of any combination of direct and indirect paths/effects.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/SimpleMed/CPAmodel.jpg}
\caption{Image of conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a path; the path between the IV and mediator}
\end{figure}

Within the CPA framework we have lots of options that generally fall into two categories:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Moderated mediation}: when an indirect effect of X on Y through M is moderated; the mechanism represented by the \emph{X-to-M-to-Y} chain of events operates to varying degrees (or not at all) for certain people or in certain contexts.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Any model in which the indirect effect (a*b) changes as a function of one or more moderators. These moderators can be operating on the a, b, or c' paths or any possible combination of the three
  \item
    X could moderate its own indirect effect on Y through M if the effect of M on Y depends on X, or
  \item
    The indirect effect of X on Y through M could be contingent on a fourth variable if that fourth variable W moderates one or more of the relationships in a three-variable causal system, or
  \item
    An indirect effect could be contingent on a moderator variable
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Mediated moderation}: an interaction between X and some moderator W on Y is carried through a mediator M;

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    mediated moderation analysis is simply a mediation analysis with the product of two variables serving as the causal agent of focus
  \item
    An interaction between a moderator W and causal agent X on outcome Y could operate through a mediator M
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Hayes argues that the mediated moderation hypotheses are ``regularly articulated and tested by scientists'' \citeyearpar[p.~459]{hayes_introduction_2018}. He warns, though, that we should not confuse the ``abundance of published examples of mediated moderation anlayses\ldots with the meaningfulness of the procedure itself'' (p.~460). He later adds that mediation moderation is ``neither interesting nor meaningful.'' Why?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Conceptualizing a process in terms of a mediated moderation misdirects attention toward a variable in the model that actually doesn't measure anything.
\item
  Most often there are moderated mediation models that are identical in equations and resulting coefficients - the difference is in the resulting attentional focus and interpretation.
\item
  Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} recommends that models proposing mediated moderation be recast in terms of moderated mediation process.
\item
  Consequently, we will not work a mediated moderation, but there is an example in chapter 12.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hayes--hayes_introduction_2018-piecewise-approach-to-building-models}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Hayes' \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} Piecewise Approach to Building Models}{Hayes' {[}-@hayes\_introduction\_2018{]} Piecewise Approach to Building Models}}\label{hayes--hayes_introduction_2018-piecewise-approach-to-building-models}}

In summarizing a strategic approach for testing structural equation models, Joreskog \citep{bollen_testing_1993} identified three scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{strictly confirmatory}: the traditional NHST approach of proposing a single, theoretically derived, model, and after analyzing the data either rejects or fails to reject the model. No further modifications are made/allowed.
\item
  \emph{alternative models}: the reseacher proposes competing (also theoretically derived) models. Following analysis of a single set of empirical data, he or she selects one model as appropriate in representing the sample data.
\item
  \emph{model generating}: A priori, the researcher acknowledges that they may/may not find what they have theoretically proposed. So, a priori, they acknowledge that in the absence of ideal fit (which is the usual circumstance), they will proceed in an exploratory fashion to respecify/re-estimate the model. The goal is to find a model that is both substantively meaningful and statistically well-fitting.
\end{itemize}

A legacy of our field is the \emph{strictly confirmatory} approach. I am thrilled when I see research experts (e.g., \citep{byrne_structural_2016}) openly endorse a model building approach. In Chapter 12, Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} demonstrates the piecewise approach to building (and understanding) a complex model.

\hypertarget{workflow-for-moderated-mediation}{%
\section{Workflow for Moderated Mediation}\label{workflow-for-moderated-mediation}}

At this point in this OER's development, I don't have a workflow graphic developed for this statistic. However, Hayes' \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} \emph{piecewise} approach to model testing/building is really the workflow. The secret is to decompose the model into its simplest moderations and mediations and analyze them separately before assembling them. When we get to the model we will analyze with this research vignette, a series of diagrams will make this more clear.

Additionally, at the end of the chapter, I offer a template of R script for the popular moderated mediation (a single moderator influencin both the \emph{a} and \emph{c'} paths).

\hypertarget{research-vignette-6}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-6}}

Once again the research vignette comes from the Lewis, Williams, Peppers, and Gadson's \citeyearpar{lewis_applying_2017} study titled, ``Applying Intersectionality to Explore the Relations Between Gendered Racism and Health Among Black Women.'' The study was published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology. Participants were 231 Black women who completed an online survey.

Variables used in the study included:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{GRMS}: Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale \citep{lewis_construction_2015} is a 26-item scale that assesses the frequency of nonverbal, verbal, and behavioral negative racial and gender slights experienced by Black women. Scaling is along six points ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (once a week or more). Higher scores indicate a greater frequency of gendered racial microaggressions. An example item is, ``Someone has made a sexually inappropriate comment about my butt, hips, or thighs.''
\item
  \textbf{MntlHlth} and \textbf{PhysHlth}: Short Form Health Survey - Version 2 \citep{ware_comparison_1995} is a 12-item scale used to report self-reported mental (six items) and physical health (six items).
  Higher scores indicate higher mental health (e.g., little or no psychological ldistress) and physical health (e.g., little or no reported symptoms in physical functioning). An example of an item assessing mental health was, ``How much of the time during the last 4 weeks have you felt calm and peaceful?''; an example of a physical health item was, ``During the past 4 weeks, how much did pain interfere with your normal work?''
\item
  \textbf{Sprtlty}, \textbf{SocSup}, \textbf{Engmgt}, and \textbf{DisEngmt} are four subscales from the Brief Coping with Problems Experienced Inventory \citep{carver_you_1997}. The 28 items on this scale are presented on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (\emph{I usually do not do this at all}) to 4(\emph{I usually do this a lot}). Higher scores indicate a respondents' tendency to engage in a particular strategy. Instructions were modified to ask how the female participants responded to recent experiences of racism and sexism as Black women. The four subscales included spirituality (religion, acceptance, planning), interconnectedness/social support (vent emotions, emotional support,instrumental social support), problem-oriented/engagement coping (active coping, humor, positive reinterpretation/positive reframing), and disengagement coping (behavioral disengagement, substance abuse, denial, self-blame, self-distraction).
\item
  \textbf{GRIcntlty}: The Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity Centrality subscale \citep{sellers_multidimensional_nodate} was modified to measure the intersection of racial and gender identity centrality. The scale included 10 items scaled from 1 (\emph{strongly disagree}) to 7 (\emph{strongly agree}). An example item was, ``Being a \emph{Black woman} is important to my self-image.'' Higher scores indicated higher levels of gendered racial identity centrality.
\end{itemize}

\section{Working the Moderated Mediation}\label{working-the-moderated-mediation}}

The model we are testing is predicting a mental health (MntlHlth, Y) from gendered racial microaggressions (GRMS,X), mediated by disengagement coping (DisEngmt, M). The relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and disengagement coping (i.e., the \emph{a} path) is expected to be moderated by gendered racial identity centrality (GRIcntlty, W). Gendered racial identity centrality is also expected to moderate the path between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health (i.e., the \emph{c'} path). Thus, the specified model involves the evaluation of a conditional indirect effect.

Hayes' \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} textbook and training materials frequently display the conceptual (above) and statistical models (below). These help facilitate understanding.

Looking at the diagram, with two consequent variables (i.e., those with arrows pointing to them) we can see two equations are needed to explain the model:

\[M = i_{M}+a_{1}X + a_{2}W + a_{3}XW + e_{M}\]

\[Y = i_{Y}+c_{1}^{'}X+ c_{2}^{'}W+c_{3}^{'}XW+ bM+e_{Y}\]

When we have complicated models such as these, Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} suggests a piecewise approach to model building. Specifically, he decompose the model into its aggregate parts: a simple mediation and two simple moderation.

We are asking, "Does GRI centrality moderate the relationship between gendered racial microaggressiona and disengagement coping?

Y = disengagement coping
X = gendered racial microaggressions
W = GRI centrality

The formula we are estimating:
\[Y=b_{0}+b_{1}X+b_{2}W+b_{3}XW+e_{Y}\]

Let's specify this simple moderation model with base R's \emph{lm()} function. Let's use the \emph{jtools} package so we get that great summ function and \emph{interactions} for the awesome plot.

Since we are just working to understand our moderations, we can run them with ``regular old'' ordinary least squares.

Looking at these results we can see that the predictors account for about 17\% of variance in disengagement coping. However, there is no significance in the predictors. Neither the IV variable (GRMS, {[}X{]}), nor the moderator (GRIcntlty, {[}Y{]})), nor its interaction (GRMS:GRIcntlty, {[}XW{]}) are significant.

It's always helpful to graph the relationship. The \emph{interaction\_plot()} function from the package, \emph{interactions} can make helpful illustrations. In the case of interactions/moderations, I like to run them ``both ways'' to see which makes more sense.

The figure with GRIcntrlty as the moderator, shows a very similar prediction of disengagement coping from gendered racial microaggressions. The figure that uses GRMS as the moderator, visually, looks like there are big differences as a function of GRMS. Looking at the Y axis (disengagement), though, shows that the scaling variables are not well-spaced.

Next, let's probe the interaction with simple slopes. Probing the interaction is a common follow-up. With these additional inferential tests we can see where in the distribution of the moderator, X has an effect on Y that is different from zero (and where it does not). There are two common approaches.

The Johnson-Neyman is a \emph{floodlight} approach and provides an indication of the places in the distribution of W (moderator) that X has an effect on Y that is different than zero. The pick-a-point is sometimes called the \emph{analysis of simple slopes} or a \emph{spotlight} approach, probes the distribution at specific values (often the \emph{M} +/- 1\emph{SD}).

The Johnson-Neyman suggests that between the GRIcntlty values of 3.02 and 9.03, the relationship between GRMS is statistically significant. We see the same result in the pick-a-point approach where at the GRIcntlty values of 4.68, 5.71, and 6.74, X has a statistically significant effect on Y. Is this a contradiction to the non-significant interaction effect?

No.~The test of interaction is an interaction about the relationship between \emph{W} and \emph{X}'s effect on \emph{Y}. Just showing that \emph{X} is significantly related to \emph{Y} for a specific value does not address any dependence upon the moderator (\emph{W}). Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} covers this well in his Chapter 14, in the section ``Reporting a Moderation Analysis.''

\textbf{What have we learned in this simple moderation?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  While there are no significant predictors (neither X, W, nor XW), the model accounts for about 17\% of variance in the DV.
\item
  Although there was a non-significant effect of GRMS on disengagement coping, analysis of simple slopes suggested a significant relationship between these variables at a given ranges of GRIcntlty.
\item
  We'll keep these in mind.

The Johnson-Neyman suggests that between the GRIcntlty values of 2.972 and 7.46, the relationship between GRMS is statistically significant. We see the same result in the pick-a-point approach where at the GRIcntlty values of 4.68, 5.71, and 6.74, X has a statistically significant effect on Y. Is this a contradiction to the non-significant interaction effect?

Again. No.~The test of interaction is an interaction about the relationship between \emph{W} and \emph{X}'s effect on \emph{Y}. Just showing that \emph{X} is significantly related to \emph{Y} for a specific value does not address any dependence upon the moderator (\emph{W}).

\textbf{What have we learned in this simple moderation?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  As predictors to the DV, disengagement coping, the IV (X), moderator (W), and its interaction term (XW) have non-significant effects. That said, the overall model was significant and accounted for 11\% of variance in the DV.
\item
  Although there was a non-significant effect of GRMS on mental health, analysis of simple slopes suggested a significant relationship between these variables at a given range of GRIcntlty.
\item
  We'll keep these in mind.

\textbf{In this simple mediation we learn}*:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \emph{a} path (GRMS --\textgreater{} DisEngmt) is statistically significant.
\item
  The \emph{b} path (DisEngmt --\textgreater{} MntlHlth) is statistically significant.
\item
  The total effect (GRMS --\textgreater{} MntlHlth) is statistically significant.
\item
  The direct effect (GRMS --\textgreater{} MntlHlth when DisEngmt is in the model) falls out of significance.
\item
  The indirect effect is statistically significant.
\item
  The model accounts for 30\% of the variance in mental health (DV) and 17\% of the variance in disengagement coping (M).
\end{itemize}

Recall how the bootstrapped, bias-corrected confidence intervals can be different? It's always good to check. In this case, CI95s and the \(p\) values are congruent.

\section{The Moderated Mediation: A Combined analysis}\label{the-moderated-mediation-a-combined-analysis}}

For a quick reminder, the diagram with labeled paths will help specify this in \emph{lavaan}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ModMed/LewisStatistical.jpg}
\caption{Image of statistical reprsentation of the conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a and c' paths}
\end{figure}

Looking at the diagram, with two consequent variables (i.e., those with arrows pointing to them) we can see two equations are needed to explain the model:

\[M = i_{M}+a_{1}X + a_{2}W + a_{3}XW + e_{M}\]

\[Y = i_{Y}+c_{1}^{'}X+ c_{2}^{'}W+c_{3}^{'}XW+ bM+e_{Y}\]
Y = MntlHlth
X = GRMS
W = DisEngmt
M = GRIcntlty

\hypertarget{specification-in-lavaan}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Specification in \emph{lavaan}}{Specification in lavaan}}\label{specification-in-lavaan}}

In the code below

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First specify the equations, hints

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the a,b,c, labels are affixed with the *(asterisk)
  \item
    interaction terms are identifed with the colon
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Create code for the intercepts (Y and M) with the form: VarName \textasciitilde{} VarName.mean*1
\item
  Create code for the mean and variance of all moderators (W, Z, etc.); these will be used in simple slopes.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Means use the form: VarName \textasciitilde{} VarName.mean*1
  \item
    Variances use the form: VarName \textasciitilde\textasciitilde VarName.var*VarName
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Calculate the \emph{index of moderated mediation}: quantifies the relationship between the moderator and the indirect effect.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To the degree that the value of the IMM is different from zero and the associated inferential test is statistically significant (bootstrapped confidence intervals are preferred; more powerful), we can conclude that the indirect effect is moderated.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The IMM is used in the formula to calculate the conditional indirect effects.
    \item
      Hayes argues that a statistically significant IMM suggest they are (boom, done, p.~430).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Create code to calculate indirect effects conditional on (\emph{M} +/- 1\emph{SD}) moderator with the general form:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    product of the indirect effect (a*b) PLUS
  \item
    the product of the IMM and the moderated value
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Because our direct path is moderated, we will use a similar process to specify the direct effects conditional on (\emph{M} +/- 1\emph{SD}) moderator with the general form:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the direct effect (c\_p1) PLUS
  \item
    the moderated value (c\_p3) at each of the three levels (\emph{M} +/- 1\emph{SD})
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Although they don't tend to be reported, you can create total effects conditional on the (\emph{M} +/- 1\emph{SD}). These are simply the sum of the c\_p and all indirect paths, specified individually, at their \emph{M} +/- 1\emph{SD} conditional values.

\[\hat{Y} = i_{Y}+c_{1}^{'}X+ c_{2}^{'}W+c_{3}^{'}XW+ bM+e_{Y}\]

\emph{Note}. IV(X) = gendered racial microaggressions; M = disengagement coping; W; gendered racial identity centrality; Y = mental health. The significance of the indirect and direct effects were calculated with bias-corrected confidence intervals (.95) bootstrap analysis.

17.78\% of the variance in disengagement coping (mediator) and 31.16\% of the variance in mental health (DV) are predicted by their respective models.

The model we tested suggested that both the indirect and direct effects should be moderated. Hayes provides a more detailed and elaborate explanation of this on pp.~447 - 458.

\hypertarget{conditional-indirect-effects}{%
\subsubsection{Conditional Indirect effects}\label{conditional-indirect-effects}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An indirect effect can be moderated if either the \emph{a} or \emph{b} path (or both) is(are) moderated.
\item
  If at least one of the indirect paths is part of a moderation, then the whole indirect (axb) path would be moderated.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In this model, we specified a moderation of the \emph{a} path.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We know if the \emph{a} path is moderated if the moderation term is statistically significant.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In our case, \(a_{3}\) GRMS:GRIcntlty was not statistically significant (\(B\) = 0.006, \(p\) = 0.862).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We also look at the \emph{Index of Moderated Mediation}. The IMM is the product of the moderated path (in this case, the value of \(a_{3}\)) and \emph{b}. If this index is 0, then the slope of the line for the indirect effect is flat. The bootstrap confidence interval associated with this test is the way to determine whether/not this slope is statistically significant from zero. In our case, IMM = -0.020, CI095 = -0.264 to 0.188. This suggests that we do not have a moderated mediation. Hayes claims the IMM saves us from formally comparing (think ``contrasts'' pairs of conditional indirect effects)
\item
  We can even get more information about the potentially moderated indirect effect by \emph{probing the conditional indirect effect}. Because an indirect effect is not normally distributed, Hayes discourages using a Johnson-Neyman approach and suggests that we use the pick-a-point. He usually selects the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles of the distribution. However, many researchers commonly report the mean+/-1SD.
\item
  at 1SD below the mean \(B\) = -0.850, CI95 -1.267 to -0.462;
\item
  at the mean \(B\) = -0.870, CI95 -1.236 to -0.594).\\
\item
  at 1SD above the mean, the conditional indirect effect was significant (\(B\) = -0.891, CI95 -1.299 to -0.565).\\
\item
  Looking at the relative consistency of the \(B\) weights and the consistently significant \(p\) values, we see that there was an indirect effect throughout the varying levels of the moderator, gendered racial identity centrality. Thus, it makes sense that this was not a moderated mediation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{conditional-direct-effect}{%
\subsubsection{Conditional Direct effect}\label{conditional-direct-effect}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The direct effect of X to Y estimates how differences in X relate to differences in Y holding constant the proposed mediator(s).
\item
  We know the direct effect is moderated if the interaction term (c\_p3)is statistically significant. In our case, it was not (\emph{B} = 0.164, \emph{p} = 0.483).
\item
  Probing a conditional direct effect is straightforward\ldots we typically use the same points as we did in the probing of the conditional indirect effect.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For both my values (mean and +/- 1SD) and Hayes values (16th, 50th, 84th percentiles), the direct effect (e.g., the effect of skepticism on willingness to donate) was not statistically significant from zero at any level of the moderator.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{model-trimming}{%
\subsection{Model trimming}\label{model-trimming}}

Hayes terms it \emph{pruning}, but suggests that when there is no moderation of an effect, the researcher may want to delete that interaction term. In our case, neither the direct nor indirect effect was moderated (although the +1\emph{SD} was close (\(B\) = -0.307, \(p\) = 0.331). Deleting these paths one at a time is typical practice because the small boost of power with each deleted path may ``turn on'' significance elsewhere. If I were to engage in model trimming, I would start with the indirect effect to see if the direct effect became moderated. This is consistent with the simple moderation we ran earlier where we saw a fanning out at one end of the distribution.

\hypertarget{apa-style-write-up-1}{%
\subsection{APA Style Write-up}\label{apa-style-write-up-1}}

\emph{Note}: Make sure to look at the write-up in the Lewis et al. \citep{lewis_applying_2017} manuscript. I am a little confused in that Figure 2 of their manuscript suggests there was a moderation of both the \emph{a} and \emph{c'} paths. However, the results in Table 4 do not provide information about the moderation to the \emph{c'} path. The Lewis et al.~write-up is an efficient one, simultaneously presenting the results of two outcome variables -- mental and physical health. While our \emph{B} weights from our simulated data map similarly onto those reported in the Lewis et al.~manuscript, we do not get get the statistically significant moderated mediation that they get.

\textbf{Primary Analyses}
Our analysis evaluated a moderation mediation model predicting mental health (Y/MntlHlth) from gendered racial microaggressions (X/GRMS) mediated by disengagement coping (M/DisEngmt). Gendered racial identity centrality (W/GRIcntrlty) was our moderating variable. We specified a moderation of path \emph{a} (X/GRMS to M/DisEngmt) and the direct path, \emph{c'} (X/GRMS to Y/MntlHlth). Data were analyzed with maximum likelihood estimation in the R package \emph{lavaan} (v. 0.6-7); the significance of effects were tested with 1000 bootstrap confidence intervals. Results of the full model are presented in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1 (\emph{a variation of the semPlot or Hayes style representation}). The formula for the mediator and dependent variable are expressed below.

\[\hat{M} = 1.417 + 0.212X + (-0.027) W + 0.006XW\]
\[\hat{Y} = 31.703 + (-1.4115)X + (-0.556)W + 0.164XW + (-3.567)M\]

Results suggested a strong and negative total effect of gendered racial microaggressions on mental health that is mediated through disengagement coping. That is, in the presence of gendered racial microaggressions, participants increased disengagement coping which, in turn, had negative effects on mental health. The index of moderated mediation was -0.020 (CI95 -0.264 to 0.188) and suggested that the indirect effects were not conditional on the values of the moderator. While there was no evidence of moderation on the indirect or direct paths, there was a statistically significant, and consistently strong, mediation throughout the range of the gendered racial identity centrality (moderator). **Because we did not have a moderated mediation, I would probably not include the rest of this paragraph (nor include the moderation figure). I just wanted to demonstrate how to talk about findings if they were significant (although I acnowledg throughat that these are non-significant).* Figure 2 illustrates the conditional effects (non-significant) of GRMS (X) on mental health (Y) among those at the traditional levels of mean and +/- 1 \emph{SD} where there is a fanning out of the effect of GRMS on when the presence of gendered racial microaggressions is low and mental health is at its highest. In this combination, mental health is even more positive in the presence of positive gendered racial identity centrality. Our model accounted for 17.78\% of the variance in the mediator (disengagement coping) and 31.16\% of the variance in the dependent variable (mental health).

\item
  Would you stop here? Or keep tinkering?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I am tempted (but out of time, at least today, so stay tuned) to delete moderation of the indirect effect to see if I can get a moderated direct effect. My choice would also depend on to what I committed in any kind of pre-registration. My approach to science tends to be \emph{model generating} \citep{bollen_testing_1993} and in his text, Hayes \citeyearpar{hayes_introduction_2018} advised authors to write about what they found -- not all the things they tried. This \emph{tinkering} remains strongly in the vein of theoretically driven analyses.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The output we get is different from the output in the journal article being used as the research vignette. Why? And should we worry about it?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We are simulating data. This gives us some advantages in that (unless we specify it), we never have missingness and our variables should be normally distributed. Because we are working from means, standard deviations, and correlations, our data will never be the same as the original researcher. That said, we can compare our results to the journal to \emph{check out work.} I am somewhat reassured that our \(B\) weights align and somewhat concerned that the index of moderated moderation was so far off. I suppose I will always doubt myself, and will therefore be open to anyone who finds an error in the specification of the model.

    The default estimator for \emph{lavaan} is maximum likelihood (ML) and Hayes uses ordinary least squares (OLS). This affects both the values of coefficients, standard errors, AND the type of statistics that are reported.
  \item
    You can ask for OLS regression by adding the statement ``estimator =''GLS". Even with this option, I have not discovered a way to obtain the \emph{F} tests for the overall model. Researchers seem to be comfortable with this, even asking for less than we did (e.g., many do not request R square).
  \item
    Best I can tell, researchers who do want this might use a combination of packages, using GLS estimators in \emph{lavaan} (this easily gets them the bootstrapped CIs) and the move to a different regression package to get the intercepts and \emph{F} tests. If I did this I would triple check to make sure that all the output really lined up.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Why did we ignore the traditional fit statistics associated with structural equation modeling (e.g., CFI, RMSEA).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I hesitate to do this with models that do not include latent variables. Therefore, we asked for an ``in-between'' amount of info that should be sufficient for publication submission (any editor may have their own preferences and ask for more).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What if I have missing data?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When we enter the \emph{lavaan} world we do get options other than multiple imputation. In today's example we used the ``sem'' fitting function. Unless otherwise specified, listwise deletion (deleting the entire case when one of its variables is used to estimate the model) is the default in \emph{lavaan}. If data are MCAR or MAR, you can add the argument \emph{missing = ``ml''} (or its alias \emph{missing = ``fiml''}). More here \url{https://users.ugent.be/~yrosseel/lavaan/lavaan2.pdf} on the 1.7/Missing data in lavaan slide.
  \item
    That said, the type of estimator matters. If you estimate your data with GLS (generalized least squares) or WLS (weighted least squares), you are required to have complete data (however you got it). We used maximum likelihood and, even though we had non-missing data, I used the \emph{missing = ``fiml''} code.

\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-6}}

The three problems described below were designed to grow during the series of chapters on simple and complex mediation, complex moderation, and conditional process analysis (i.e,. this chapter). I have recommended that you select a dataset that includes at least four variables. If you are new to this topic, you may wish to select variables that are all continuously scaled. The IV and moderator (next chapters) could be categorical (if they are dichotomous, please use 0/1 coding; if they have more than one category it is best if they are ordered). You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis.

The suggested practice problem for this chapter is to conduct a simple mediation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are a number of variables in the dataset. Swap out one or more variables in the model of simple mediation and compare your solution to the one in the chapter.
\item
  Conduct a simple mediation with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article.
\end{itemize}

If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation, then rework the problem. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar.
